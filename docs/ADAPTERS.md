# Writing a band adapter

An adapter is `lib/ble/adapters/adapter.dart`'s `BandAdapter`: an `entry`
(identity — service UUID, characteristics, the registry row), a `signals`
declaration, and one `run(BandLink)` that yields `BandEvent`s. Nothing else.

## The size difference, both real numbers

- **A live-only notify sensor**: `ble_hrs.dart` is **84 lines** — no
  handshake, no clock, no INIT, one `notify()` subscription decoded straight
  into `SampleBatch`s. This is the honest floor for "how little an adapter can
  be", and it is the shape almost every future band should aim to stay near.
- **A framed, authed, offloading band** (gen4/gen5): the drain policy alone —
  `SeqAllocator`, `CounterRegressionDetector`, `AckRetryPolicy`,
  `TrimAckPolicy`, `BurstTrimGuard` and their neighbours in `ble_state.dart`,
  plus the connect/bond/MTU/INIT/offload state machine in `ble_engine.dart` —
  is easily **1,000+ lines**, and `ble_engine.dart` alone is over 8,000. That
  is the real cost of a band with a clock to set, a handshake to pass, a flash
  buffer to drain and trim, and a safe-trim invariant to never get wrong.

Neither number is a target. A band that is genuinely live-only should cost
close to 84 lines; a band that offloads history should expect to pay
something like the second number, not be squeezed into the first.

## iOS: only the primary device gets background restore

`BleRestoreManager.swift`'s restore `CBCentralManager` and the
AccessorySetupKit provisioning flow exist for the ONE primary band — the
device the offload engine drives and the device iOS is told about at pairing.
No second device gets iOS's background relaunch-on-drop treatment. What a
second device does in the background then depends on WHY it is connected, and
the two cases are not the same:

- **A live notify sensor** (a chest strap over `HrsLink`) has nothing to
  offload: it measures only while it is streaming. It streams while the app is
  foregrounded and goes quiet the moment the app is backgrounded or killed,
  until it is reopened. This is a real, current limitation — state it to a user
  (or a future contributor) directly rather than let it be discovered through a
  bug report about missing overnight strap data.
- **An offloading second device** (the Oura ring) DOES sync headless, because
  it does not need its own wake: `runHeadlessSync` calls
  `OuraLink.instance.sync()` at the end of every headless cycle, after the
  band's work is finished and its lease released, so the ring rides the OS wake
  window the band already earned. That call connects, drains history from the
  ring's own cursor, and disconnects inside the one call. It is deliberately
  best-effort and wrapped: a ring failure must never mark the band's cycle as
  errored. The ring still has no wake source OF ITS OWN — no band wake, no ring
  sync.

## Declare INPUTS, never capability booleans

`signals.dart`'s whole header explains why: a capability boolean
(`supportsSpo2()`) names an OUTPUT, so metric N+1 widens every adapter's
interface and turns a new metric into a change with a blast radius the size of
the device count. A signal names a physical INPUT — `InputSignal.rrIntervals`,
`hr1Hz`, `accel1Hz`, `skinTempRaw`, and so on — that is true independent of
any metric anyone has written yet.

`adapter.dart`'s own doc on `BandAdapter.signals` (around the class's
`signals` getter, near the `A declared-but-absent signal is WORSE than a
missing one` note) states the asymmetry directly: an UNDECLARED signal makes
every dependent metric abstain, cleanly, through the absence contract that
already exists everywhere in this codebase. A DECLARED-BUT-ABSENT signal is
worse — it tells every dependent metric "this input exists" and then hands it
nothing, which is a silent wrong answer rather than a clean refusal.

There is deliberately **no** `ecg` / `ppgWaveform` member on `InputSignal`
(`signals.dart`'s closing comment says so explicitly). `decoded_onehz` is one
row per second and raw prunes at three days — a waveform has nowhere to live
today. Adding the member before a store exists for it would let an adapter
declare a capability with nothing behind it, which is exactly the
declared-but-absent trap above. Build the store first.

## Where an adapter may NOT reach

Enforced by `test/observation_isolation_test.dart` and the seams it guards:

- **No `observation` table access of its own.** An adapter that has numbers
  the band computed itself yields a `VendorScalars` event; the HOST (`M1`'s
  `BandHost`, in `lib/ble/adapters/host.dart`) is the only thing that calls
  `LocalDb.putObservations`, outside the commit-then-confirm chain and
  best-effort, because a vendor scalar is not substrate and must never hold up
  the flash release a real offload ACK earns.
- **No `decoded_*` insert of its own.** The host commits every `SampleBatch`
  through the same durable path every other device uses
  (`commitSyncBatch` / `commitNativeBatch`); an adapter that wrote directly
  would bypass the safe-trim invariant (commit before ACK, verbatim-token
  echo) that the whole offload design exists to protect.
- **No `attribution` the host invents.** `Observation.attribution` is what a
  user reads next to a vendor number — "Oura", "Amazfit" — and it is not
  renderable without one. The adapter that knows which vendor it is supplies
  it; the host never guesses one to fill a gap.
