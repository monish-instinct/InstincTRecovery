/**
 * Owns the single long-lived [FlutterEngine], created LAZILY via [ensureEngine].
 * MainActivity attaches to it (via getCachedEngineId) instead of creating its own,
 * and does NOT destroy it when the Activity is finished (shouldDestroyEngineWithHost
 * = false).
 *
 * Why retained: when the user swipes the app from recents, Android destroys the
 * Activity and, with a default Activity-owned engine, tears the engine down too
 * (onDetachedFromEngine in logcat). That kills the Dart VM — and with it
 * flutter_blue_plus's BLE connection AND the notification-relay stream. By retaining
 * the engine and keeping the process alive with the EdgeTracking foreground service,
 * the Dart side keeps running headless after task removal.
 *
 * Why LAZY (moved out of Application.onCreate): the process is also started by
 * widget update alarms, KeepAliveWorker runs, CDM device-presence binds and Tasker
 * broadcasts — wakes that need ZERO Dart. Widgets render native snapshots from
 * prefs; the worker/CDM paths just start EdgeTrackingService, whose own onCreate
 * calls [ensureEngine]; TaskerReceiver has an engine-dead fallback. Cold-booting a
 * full FlutterEngine + Dart main() for each of those wakes was pure battery burn on
 * exactly the devices (background-restricted / low-RAM) that kill the process most
 * often. Accepted trade-off: the system-bound NotificationListener can cold-start
 * the process engine-less, so relayed notification buzzes drop until the tracking
 * service starts (CDM presence when the band is in range — the only time a buzz
 * can land anyway — or the ≤15 min KeepAliveWorker).
 *
 * The trade-off is RAM while the engine IS up: intended cost of a persistent
 * foreground BLE companion, matching the foreground-service model.
