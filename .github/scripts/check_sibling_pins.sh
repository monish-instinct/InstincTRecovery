# to live in both places to actually protect a release.
#
# This pin-drift class has bitten the project repeatedly:
#   - v43 rode a floating `main` ref and silently picked up a breaking change
#   - 2026-07-20: the pinned SHA didn't actually contain the analytics fix a
#     changelog entry cited — the bug it "fixed" stayed live for 3 releases
#   - 2026-07-26: a local `flutter pub get` run WITH pubspec_overrides.yaml
#     present rewrote the tracked pubspec.lock to local path sources,
#     silently dropping the git provenance — happened twice in one session
#   - 2026-07-30: edge shipped a full day pinned one merge behind BOTH
#     protocol and analytics main — including a protocol fix for a decoder
#     bug that could eat up to 4092 bytes of good historical data — because
#     nothing ever re-checked the pin against upstream after it was set
#
# Two independent checks, run per sibling package:
#   1. pubspec.lock actually resolves what pubspec.yaml pins (not a local
#      path, not some other ref). FATAL — catches the pub-get-with-overrides
#      class above; a release built from this state doesn't contain what its
#      own pin claims.
#   2. the pinned ref is not stale against the sibling's current main.
#      NON-FATAL (a warning annotation, not a build failure) — a deliberate
#      short lag while a fix bakes is a legitimate call for a maintainer to
#      make, but per 2026-07-30 it must be a call someone actually makes,
#      not a silent default nobody notices. Skipped (not failed) if the
#      sibling repo can't be reached — a network hiccup here must not block
#      an otherwise-good build.
