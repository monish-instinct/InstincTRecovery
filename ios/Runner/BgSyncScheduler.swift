/// BGTaskScheduler bridge for OpenStrap Edge.
///
/// Registers a BGProcessingTask (identifier: "wtf.openstrap.edge.bgsync") that
/// iOS runs opportunistically when the device is idle. On task launch it calls
/// the Dart `openstrap/bg_task` channel → `run`, which runs runHeadlessSync() +
/// a heavy DerivationEngine pass, then signals completion.
///
/// Task identifier scoped to wtf.openstrap.edge.
///
/// Design notes:
///   - "location" is NOT added to UIBackgroundModes: OpenStrap has no GPS /
///     workout-route feature; adding it without purpose risks App Store review
///     rejection. We use "processing" + "fetch" only.
///   - Uses BGProcessingTaskRequest (not BGAppRefreshTaskRequest): allows a
///     longer wall-clock budget and does not require user-granted Background App
///     Refresh — more reliable for compute-heavy sync+derive.
///
/// Call order from AppDelegate:
///   1. BGTaskScheduler.shared.register(forTaskIdentifier:...) in didFinishLaunching
///      (BEFORE super returns) — the OS needs this call before launch completes.
///   2. handleTask(_:) wired as the task handler in that same register block.
///   3. wireChannel(messenger:) called from didInitializeImplicitFlutterEngine so
///      the Flutter binary messenger is available for Dart callout.
///   4. schedule() called after wireChannel so the first request is queued once
///      Dart is ready, and again on every applicationDidEnterBackground.
