// HKWorkoutRoute → Dart. The `health` plugin this app already depends on reads
// workouts but has no route API whatsoever (the string "route" does not appear
// anywhere in health 11.1.1's lib/, ios/ or android/ sources), and a route is
// the one thing in an imported workout that cannot be reconstructed from the
// summary. So: the smallest possible channel — one method, coordinates only.
//
// Workouts themselves are deliberately NOT read here. The plugin already does
// that correctly on both platforms, and duplicating it natively would mean two
// definitions of "a workout" that could drift. This returns coordinates keyed
// by the workout's uuid, and Dart joins them to the workouts it already has.
//
// The uuid string is `workout.uuid.uuidString`, which is byte-identical to what
// the plugin emits for the same sample ("\(sample.uuid)"), so the join is exact
// rather than a start-time match with a tolerance.
