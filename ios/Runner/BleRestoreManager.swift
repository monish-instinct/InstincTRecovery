/// Keeps the app eligible for background relaunch when the paired WHOOP band becomes
/// reachable — the mechanism WHOOP/Garmin use on iOS (CoreBluetooth State Preservation
/// & Restoration). No persistent notification, no foreground service.
///
/// Running this as a SEPARATE CBCentralManager (distinct restoration identifier) from
/// the "live" central flutter_blue_plus drives is an Apple-documented, supported pattern,
/// not an inferred workaround: "Because apps can have multiple instances of
/// CBCentralManager... be sure each restoration identifier is unique, so that the system
/// can properly distinguish one central... from another" (Core Bluetooth Background
/// Processing for iOS Apps). Confirmed directly against that doc — this is not a deviation
/// from a single-manager model Apple only describes for the simple case.
///
/// It does NOT drain data. flutter_blue_plus owns the real GATT session, and two
/// CBCentralManagers can't share a peripheral connection. This is a trigger only: it
/// holds a no-timeout pending connect to the band (under a restore identifier) so iOS
/// relaunches us when the band shows up, then it cancels its own connection and tells
/// Flutter to run the normal headless sync.
///
/// This is RECOVERY-ONLY: normal sync is the kept-alive live connection + the AppState
/// flusher. The restore central arms a no-timeout pending connect ONLY when Dart tells
/// it the connection dropped (`setOwnsBand(false)` / `arm`). No timers, no cooldown.
///
/// Loop prevention is event-driven, not time-based: after a wake hands off to Dart and
/// Dart reports the drain done (`syncDone`), we go IDLE and do NOT re-arm. We re-arm only
/// on the next explicit request from Dart (a fresh disconnect). Arming only happens while
/// backgrounded; in the foreground flutter_blue_plus owns the band.
///
/// Verified against Apple's official docs ("Core Bluetooth Background Processing for iOS
/// Apps"): a state-restoration relaunch is a BOUNDED wake, not indefinite runtime — "an app
/// has around 10 seconds to complete a task... apps that spend too much time executing in
/// the background can be throttled back by the system or killed," and even a fully
/// backgrounded app "can't run forever... the system may need to terminate your app to free
/// up memory." This is exactly why the headless sync this triggers (background_sync.dart's
/// runHeadlessSync) is designed to make partial progress safely on every wake — commit
/// whatever it drained before the window closes, resume from the durable cursor next time —
/// rather than assuming it gets to run to completion in one continuous background session.

/// Per-peripheral restore state. Replaces the three process-wide flags
/// (`handedOff` / `idleAfterSync` / `appOwnsBand`), which were only ever correct
/// while exactly one band could be provisioned: with two, band A's foreground
/// connect set `appOwnsBand = true` and suppressed band B's background re-arm,
/// presenting days later as "the app stopped syncing overnight" with no error.
