// Strain's resting-HR reference, and the HRV timeline's clock.
//
// Both were confident-wrong-number bugs on the same seam, fixed in v68:
//
//   • The offloaded second half recomputed the headline strain from
//     `scalars.rhr`, which the pure pipeline is ALLOWED to fall back to daytime
//     HR for (that fallback exists for the general resting-HR card). On a day
//     with no detected sleep that reference ran ~20 bpm high, which shrinks the
//     HR reserve and manufactures strain out of sitting still — and it was then
//     written over `scalars.strain` even on days where the pure pipeline had
//     already abstained. It now reads `scalars.rhr_nocturnal`, and abstains.
//
//   • `series.hrv_timeline` stored `t` as seconds since the first NN beat
//     (`correctRr` re-bases its clock to 0) on a view whose contract says epoch
//     seconds, and emitted its first point after 10 beats (~8 s) on a line
//     documented as rolling 5-min windows.
