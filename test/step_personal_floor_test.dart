// The 1 Hz activity estimator's PERSONAL floor — the edge half of the fix for
// the "39,384 steps" bug.
//
// The analytics package decides activity from a calibration-invariant dynamic
// amplitude, but it is pure: it cannot read history, so it cannot know what
// "moving" means for this wearer. Edge supplies that. Each day persists its own
// high quantile of the dynamic amplitude (`dyn_p90`), and the next day's derive
// takes the MEDIAN across trailing days as its floor.
//
// Two properties matter here and neither is obvious from the analytics tests:
//
//   1. COLD START ABSTAINS. Below the minimum history there is no floor, and the
//      estimator must return absent rather than fall back to a constant.
//      Falling back to a constant is precisely the bug: the old estimator's
//      absolute 0.05 g floor was the same magnitude as the gravity-reference
//      error, so a quiet day's sedentary minutes cleared it for hours.
//
//   2. A SINGLE ANOMALOUS DAY CANNOT MOVE THE FLOOR. That is why the anchor is
//      a median across days rather than a same-day quantile — a same-day floor
//      collapses on a quiet day and passes everything, the mirror image of the
//      absolute-constant failure.
