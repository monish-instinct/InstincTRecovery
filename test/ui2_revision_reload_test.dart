// A write landed underneath a screen that is already on screen. Does it show?
//
// The bug this pins: "I imported something, and to see those workouts in
// Workouts I have to switch to another tab and come back." Every screen here
// loads in `initState`, and three of the five tabs are kept alive by the
// shell's IndexedStack for the life of the process — so "loads once" means
// "until the app is relaunched", and leaving the tab was the workaround.
//
// The test below writes UNDERNEATH a live screen and asserts the screen
// updates while keeping the SAME State object. Asserting only that the text
// appears would pass for the same wrong reason switching tabs does — a fresh
// widget reading the database for the first time.
