//
// They used to come from two different implementations. `calories` was summed
// by a derivation-local copy of Keytel (`_keytelCaloriesWake`) that billed the
// FULL Keytel rate on every active minute, while `calories_total` came from
// `ana.Calories.dailyEnergy`, whose active component nets out the basal minute
// you are also counting inside the total. The same minute was therefore paid
// for twice in `calories`: once as basal (inside total) and again as part of
// the active rate. Active read high by exactly basalPerMin x active-minutes,
// and the basal figure the Health export derives as `total - active` read low
// by the same amount.
//
// The expected values below are computed by hand from the published formulas
// (Mifflin-St Jeor 1990 for BMR, Keytel 2005 for the active rate) so this test
// pins real arithmetic rather than whatever the implementation happens to emit.
