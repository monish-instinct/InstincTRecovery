// Regression tests for the phone-clock trust gate — the thing standing between
// a phone whose wall clock is a day slow and permanent, silent data loss.
//
// The failure it guards: when the phone reads slow, the strap's correctly
// stamped records look "implausibly future", the record gate drops them, and
// the HISTORY_END ACK then trims them off the band's flash for good. So while
// the phone is the suspect party we neither drain history nor push our wall
// clock onto the strap.
//
// Both halves of that refusal were reachable around, which is what these cover:
// the SET_CLOCK half was handed straight back by the drift-correction retry
// sitting behind the gate's own read-back.
