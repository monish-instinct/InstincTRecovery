/// This card was built blind and shipped three defects a rendered check would
/// have caught immediately: a negative `Container.margin` (Flutter asserts
/// `margin.isNonNegative`, so it threw on every build and painted a
/// 358x100000 overflow stripe), the mascot stacked UNDER the copy at 176 px
/// inside a 190 px card with no clip, and `'\$count activities'` with the
/// dollar escaped, which printed the literal text to the user.
///
/// It is excluded from the gallery on purpose — a full-bleed card cannot be
/// photographed in a ~179 px component cell without the fixture, not the card,
/// being what the golden shows. This stands in for that.
