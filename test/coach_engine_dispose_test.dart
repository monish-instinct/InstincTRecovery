// The coach chat screen used to own CoachEngine's lifetime directly: navigating
// away (or the app backgrounding) called `engine.dispose()`, which closed the
// shared http.Client out from under any request still in flight. For a local
// model that can legitimately take minutes to respond, that meant leaving the
// screen — even briefly — silently killed the request: no reply, no error, no
// trace, because the ClientException that resulted was thrown into a screen
// state that no longer existed to show it.
//
// Reported live: a user sent several messages to a local Ollama endpoint,
// server-side logs showed each one being processed, but the app showed nothing
// for any of them. `requestDispose` is the fix: it defers the actual
// `http.Client.close()` until any in-flight `send()` has genuinely finished,
// so the request either completes or fails for a real reason — never because
// the user looked away.
