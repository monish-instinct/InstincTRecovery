// "Delete everything" must not be repopulated by the band it is deleting.
//
// `resetAllData()` wipes the database but leaves the strap CONNECTED — its own
// documented order puts `signOut` (and the `unpair` inside it) LAST, because
// that flips the route and unwinds the UI. So the band keeps handing over
// historical records straight across the wipe, and one that lands after it is
// written into the fresh database and re-advertised as the data edge: the
// deleted installation, visible again on Home, with nothing left to explain it.
//
// `AppState._resetting` is the refusal flag that closes that window. It is
// private, and `resetAllData` needs the whole plugin stack (preferences,
// notifications, widget, telemetry, keychain) to run at all, so there is no
// behavioural test to write here. This greps instead — the same approach, and
// for the same reason, as `link_priority_structural_test.dart` and
// `no_debug_only_apis_test.dart`: the failure mode is a NEW ingest path added
// later that simply forgets the guard, which no test that runs the code can
// see.
//
// What is pinned:
//   1. every record-ingest callback AppState hands the engine checks
//      `_resetting` before it writes
//   2. `resetAllData` raises the flag, and lowers it in a `finally` (a
//      half-reset install that silently drops every record is worse than the
//      race it was closing)
//   3. `LocalDb.insertRecordsBatch` is not passed as a bare tear-off anywhere
//      in AppState — that is exactly how the drain path bypassed the guard
