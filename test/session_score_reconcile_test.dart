// Issue #206: a live session's strain is accumulated in RAM by the foreground
// app. Backgrounded (iOS suspends the 1 Hz timer) or killed mid-workout, that
// accumulator misses most of the workout — commonly leaving a handful of
// sub-resting minutes whose Banister TRIMP is exactly 0, which `strainScore`
// reports as a confident 0.0 next to a real duration and real HR.
//
// `reconcileSessionScore` merges that partial tally with a re-score of the same
// window from the 1 Hz substrate the band banked. These tests pin the merge
// rule (max, because both sides are lower bounds over subsets of one window's
// minutes) and the properties that make repeated application safe.
