// M6 -- who wins a metric whose required signals do NOT agree.
//
// `signalWinners` + `unanimousWinner` are what the metric-detail caption and
// its "Prefer this device" button read. The pair exists because the screen
// used to read `signalPriority(spec.requires.first)` and call that winner the
// metric's preferred device: readiness needs four signals, and one of them
// cannot answer for the other three.
//
// Opens a real LocalDb (the `coverage_devices_by_day_test.dart` idiom) because
// `signalWinners` reads `device_coverage` directly since the kAlgoVersion 91
// fix: a device with coverage rows but no stored priority row (paired after
// the user last customized ranking) must still be found, the same union
// `_resolveOwnership` does in derivation_engine.dart.
