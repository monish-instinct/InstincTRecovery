// Tests for the charging/low-battery alert de-dupe (issue #179 — "repeated
// 'band is on the charger' well after the charger was removed").
//
// The strap dumps its buffered event log on connect and re-sends events it has
// already delivered, so DeviceAlerts cannot treat a chargingOn frame as proof
// that the puck went on just now. Two guards are asserted here:
//   • RECENCY — an hours-old chargingOn is a backlog replay, not news.
//   • IDENTITY — a charge session already announced never announces again, and
//     the record of that survives a process restart (the Android failure: the
//     pre-warmed engine + KeepAliveWorker + START_STICKY FGS recreate the
//     process routinely, and the edge state used to live only in RAM).
//
// Both fakes are injected, so nothing here touches the platform plugin or real
// SharedPreferences.
