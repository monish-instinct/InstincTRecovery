///
/// NOTE ON TIMEZONE. Dart reads the process timezone from the environment and
/// `flutter test` cannot set it per-test, so the DST cases here assert on the
/// BOUNDARY LOGIC (zero-width buckets are skipped, not fatal) in a way that
/// holds in every timezone, rather than hard-coding a US transition. The
/// spring-forward instant collapse itself was reproduced directly against the
/// Dart runtime under `TZ=America/New_York` while diagnosing:
///
///     h=1  from=2026-03-08 01:00  to=2026-03-08 03:00
///     h=2  from=2026-03-08 03:00  to=2026-03-08 03:00   <-- zero width
///
/// With `break` there, hours 3-23 were never queried and the day was persisted
/// with ~3 hours of windows.
