// The router and the onboarding decisions, as pure functions.
//
// Onboarding is the flow a user walks through exactly once, so a bug here is
// a bug nobody reports and everybody hits. Two of the cases below are the
// audit's findings written down as regressions:
//
//   · a profile form that promised optional fields and then refused to
//     continue without them,
//   · a pairing screen with no way out of a refused bond.
//
// The deep-link cases exist because a notification is scheduled days before
// it is tapped: a payload written by an older build must still land somewhere
// deterministic after the five tabs were renamed.
