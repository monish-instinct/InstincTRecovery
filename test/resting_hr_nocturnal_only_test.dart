// A resting heart rate is nocturnal or it is absent.
//
// `scalars.rhr` used to fall back to the whole DAY's HR when no sleep was
// scored, and the fallback was published as the resting heart rate: it drives
// the Heart card and chart, it is the `metric_series` key the personal baseline
// folds, and it is what HealthKit receives.
//
// MEASURED, on the owner's own export (17 days, 671,847 1 Hz rows). His fifteen
// full-wear nights read 55.7–64.2 bpm. 2026-07-31 was worn 213 minutes with no
// night scored at all, and published 88.0 bpm as a resting heart rate — a
// 24-30 bpm error rendered as a measurement. A second export published 116.7
// the same way. There is no tier at which "the quietest half hour of a day
// spent awake" is a resting heart rate; it is a different quantity wearing the
// label, so the only honest output is absence with its reason.
//
// The gate lived one level too high before this: v47 moved READINESS onto the
// nocturnal-only `rhr_nocturnal` and left the charted `rhr` on the fallback.
