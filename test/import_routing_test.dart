// Issues #160 / #199: the onboarding router picked an importer by FILE
// EXTENSION, and got it wrong in both directions at once.
//
//   • NOOP's Android "raw sensor CSV" export is a plain `.csv`, so it went to
//     the vendor importer, which told the user to re-download it with WHOOP
//     set to English. (That is the exact file attached to #160.)
//   • A WHOOP "My Data" export is a `.zip` of CSVs — the shape WHOOP actually
//     gives you — so it went to the NOOP importer, which refused it for
//     holding too many CSVs.
//
// Both files were fine. Both were refused, each with advice meant for the
// other one. These tests drive the real `runImport` and assert WHICH importer
// each shape reaches, so neither direction can come back.
