// A live session and the substrate re-score of the SAME heart-rate stream must
// report the same calories.
//
// They did not. The live tick billed the raw Keytel active rate for every
// second the band delivered a heart rate, with no activity gate and no resting
// floor, while `Calories.estimateBoutCalories` (which the re-score and every
// manually logged session use) bills the Harris-Benedict RESTING rate for any
// sample below resting + 0.30 x HRR and the Keytel rate only above it. For a
// 34 y 72 kg male the two rates differ by ~2x at 70 bpm, so warm-up, rest
// between sets and cool-down were billed at roughly double, and the number on
// the live gauge did not survive its own re-score.
//
// The live tick now RECOMPUTES from the retained series through the same
// published rates and the same gate, rather than accruing. That is the shape
// `accrueHr` already uses for strain, and it is what lets a nightly resting HR
// that lands mid-session correct the whole bout instead of only the seconds
// after it arrived.
//
// The retained series is per-SAMPLE seconds-at-each-bpm, not per-minute means.
// The first version of this fix used per-minute means and stayed wrong in three
// ways none of the original cases here could see, because they all ran a 1 Hz
// stream whose single transition landed exactly on a minute boundary:
//
//   * the gate is per sample in the re-score and was per minute-MEAN here, so a
//     minute straddling the gate went wholly to one rate;
//   * a completed minute billed a flat 60 s regardless of how many samples
//     backed it, and the minute in progress billed its SAMPLE COUNT as seconds;
//   * a contact-loss gap billed 0 s live while the re-score bills the pre-gap
//     sample for the gap, capped at 150 s.
//
// The last four cases in this file are each one of those.
