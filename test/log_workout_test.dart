// THE TWO SCREENS THE UI REBUILD LEFT OUT, RENDERED.
//
// Reading a widget tree does not find layout bugs — this project has paid for
// that three times over (a negative margin asserts, an OverflowBox blanks a
// whole tab, Expanded and Flexible in one Row split it 50/50). Both of these
// are pumped at a real phone width, and both are driven: the form's validation
// is exercised through the controls a thumb would use, not by calling the pure
// function underneath it.
//
// Neither screen gets an AppState here on purpose. `repoOf`/`appOf` return
// null without one, which is exactly the golden case — a screen that cannot
// reach the repository must still render its own absence rather than throw.
