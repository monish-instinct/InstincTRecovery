// Regression tests for the scheduled-reminder wall-clock arithmetic.

// NotificationService._nextInstanceOf used to advance with absolute Durations:
//   d = d.add(const Duration(days: 1));                       // weekday walk
//   d = d.add(Duration(days: weekday != null ? 7 : 1));        // roll forward
// A Duration is ELAPSED time, not a calendar day. Across a DST transition the
// wall-clock time therefore drifts by an hour: the Sunday-18:00 weekly recap
// computed over a spring-forward landed at 19:00 (and at 17:00 over a
// fall-back), and the bedtime / hydration dailies drifted the same way.
//
// nextInstanceOf now rebuilds the TZDateTime from its calendar fields, so the
// tz database resolves whatever UTC offset that day carries.
