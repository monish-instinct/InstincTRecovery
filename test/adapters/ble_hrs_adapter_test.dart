// The mandatory adapter test (MULTIBAND_PLAN §3.3.3): replay a fixture through
// a [ReplayBandLink] and assert that every signal the adapter DECLARES really
// appears in what it EMITS.
//
// Why this one and not a decode test: a declared-but-absent signal is worse
// than a missing one. A missing signal deletes its card through the absence
// contract; a declared one that never arrives leaves a card permanently empty
// with nothing to point at. The decode itself is pinned in `hrs_link_test.dart`
// against the SIG layout.
//
// This is also the worked example a contributor copies —
// `test/adapters/<id>_test.dart`, ~40 lines, no hardware, no mocks.
