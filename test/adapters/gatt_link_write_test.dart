// ASSUMPTIONS G5: `GattBandLink.write` shipped without the two wire guards
// `BleEngine._write` has had since the batch-ACK path was written — write-chain
// serialisation, and the staleness guard that stops a write queued by a dead
// session landing on a live one. Both are silent when they are missing: the
// frame is simply dropped, reordered, or written to the wrong connection.
//
// `flutter_blue_plus` has no simulator path, so this drives the link with NO
// services and its `debugWriteHook` — which is why that hook exists. The guards
// are checked BEFORE the hook, so what is asserted here is the real path.
