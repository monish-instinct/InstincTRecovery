// THE BEATS SCREEN — the four things it may not get wrong.
//
// None of them are layout. Every one is an honesty rule this screen is under,
// and every one of them is a sentence a future edit could delete without
// breaking a pixel:
//
//   * the rhythm screen may not reassure, may not diagnose, and must draw
//     "never screened" as a DIFFERENT MARK from "screened and did not fire" —
//     not a fainter one;
//   * deceleration capacity gets no threshold, no reference range and no
//     verdict colour, and never appears without its anchor count;
//   * a night whose beats have been pruned says the beats are gone and still
//     prints the numbers taken from them — it is not an empty state;
//   * a half-hour bin that abstained stays a hole and is never joined across.
//
// The shape numbers in the fixture are real: they are the owner's night of
// 2026-08-15 as `Export.db` holds it (29 832 clean NN of 30 117 read, SD1 29.9,
// SD2 150.7, 17 bins with one hole, 10 435 PRSA anchors).
