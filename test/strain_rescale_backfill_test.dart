// history CANNOT be re-derived from raw — the engine logs "no substrate (raw
// pruned) — kept" and keeps the old row. It does not need raw: strain is a pure
// function of (TRIMP, wake minutes, sex). `metric_series` stores `trimp`, and
// the wake window is READ from `series.strain_curve` (one point per wake
// minute) rather than reconstructed as `worn_min − tst_min`, which is a
// different quantity — measured −15..+22 min off on six of six real days.
