// HONESTY REGRESSION — a day-relative stamp must not outlive its day.
//
// `_refreshCrossDayInputArtifact` marks the most recent record `is_today: true`
// so today-scoped reads (`_todayNum`) can tell "today abstained" from "today has
// no row yet". That stamp is a fact ABOUT A DAY stored as a bare boolean, and it
// is written into the DURABLE `crossday_input` baseline row.
//
// `_crossDayInputDays()` prefers that cached row whenever it parses. So a cache
// written yesterday hands back a series whose last record still claims
// `is_today: true` — and `_todayNum` then reports YESTERDAY's strain and nap
// minutes as today's, landing them inside `need_sec`. That is precisely the
// imputation the stamp exists to prevent (AGENTS §3.3), re-entering through the
// cache rather than through `_lastNum`.
//
// Today the four `_runCrossDay` call sites each refresh the artifact immediately
// beforehand, so the stale read is not reachable in practice. That is an
// unenforced ordering coincidence, not a guarantee: one new caller, or one early
// return inside `_refreshBaselines`, makes it live and silent. The envelope now
// carries the day it was built for, and this predicate is the only thing allowed
// to declare a cached artifact reusable.
