// Regression tests for the READINESS ring BOUNCING to ~100 and back (#117, the
// ready→ready case).
//
// Root cause: the composite maps its weighted robust-z to a 0–100 score via a
// logistic `score = 100 / (1 + exp(-z))`. `robustZ` (analytics util) only nulls
// on EXACT-zero MAD; a near-degenerate baseline (e.g. duplicate-day pollution
// collapsing the window toward one value) has a tiny NON-zero MAD, so robustZ
// returns a huge z, the logistic saturates, and today's headline flashes ~100
// until a cleaner re-derive snaps it back — a ready→ready bounce the
// `overnight_state == 'ready'` gate can't catch (the state is `ready` throughout).
//
// The fix (`headlineReadinessScalar` / `kReadinessZCap`) abstains from a
// saturated, physiologically-impossible readiness rather than persisting the
// bogus ~100, so no wrong value is ever headlined on any surface. These tests pin
// the saturation → abstain behaviour and prove a clean derive is unaffected.
