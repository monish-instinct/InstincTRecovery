// Issue #200, the other half: keep ONE decision point for the link interval.
//
// `link_priority_policy_test.dart` pins the stepping RULE, and the
// LinkPriority → ConnectionPriority mapping arm by arm. Neither can pin that
// the engine still routes THROUGH them. The original bug was not a wrong
// policy — it was no policy at all: a literal
//
//     device.requestConnectionPriority(
//       connectionPriorityRequest: ConnectionPriority.high)
//
// sat in the connect path, ran once, and nothing ever stepped it back down. A
// future refactor of that path can re-add exactly that line, and every
// behavioural test in this repo would stay green, because `desiredLinkPriority`
// would still return the right answer to a caller that no longer exists.
//
// There is no BLE fake here to assert against, so this greps instead — same
// approach as `no_debug_only_apis_test.dart`, for the same reason (the failure
// is invisible to any test that runs the code):
//
//   1. exactly ONE real `requestConnectionPriority` call in lib/, in the engine
//   2. that call sits inside `_applyLinkPriority`, its argument is exactly
//      `connectionPriorityFor(want)`, and that `want` is assigned from
//      `desiredLinkPriority` — so no link in the chain can be short-circuited
//   3. every `ConnectionPriority.<value>` literal is inside the mapper
//   4. the mapper is declared once, in the engine, and stays @visibleForTesting
//   5. exactly ONE `desiredLinkPriority` declaration, in `sync/sync_policy.dart`
//
// (5) matters because (3) is scoped per-file: a second copy of the policy in
// another lib/ file would carry its own literals and quietly satisfy (3) while
// the engine stopped being the single decision point.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: assert the mapping is CORRECT. A grep
// cannot tell `LinkPriority.lowPower => ConnectionPriority.lowPower` from
// `=> ConnectionPriority.high`, and the latter is #200 restored — so that is
// `link_priority_policy_test.dart`'s job, and (4) is what keeps it able to do
// it. The two files are only jointly sufficient.
//
// Comments and string literals are stripped by `support/dart_source.dart`; see
// there for why that is subtler than a regex. Both matter here: this file names
// the offending API in prose, and the engine's own failure log is
// `_log('requestConnectionPriority(...) failed: $e')`, so a naive text count
// reports two calls where there is one.
