//
// F-31: `day_result`'s PRIMARY KEY is (day_id, algo_version), so versions are
// SIBLINGS, not replacements. Every reader picked `MAX(algo_version)` with no
// ceiling, which is right on the way UP and wrong on the way DOWN: after a
// downgrade (store rollback, TestFlight → release) a re-derive writes a row at
// the LOWER version that MAX() then ignores forever. Day-detail (reading the
// bundle) and trends (reading the unversioned, always-overwritten
// `metric_series`) end up permanently disagreeing about the same day, and no
// re-derive can repair it.
//
// Plus: the counter index is gone, `sessions.start_ts` is indexed, and
// `decodedRecTsMaxByDay` no longer groups by a function of the column.
