// `sessions.type` to HealthKit / Health Connect activity map and record title,
// which the mapper's own doc comment has named as tested here since #184
// without the file existing.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT CATCH. It pins the app's own switch, on both
// platform branches, which a host VM is the only place to do: `Platform.isIOS`
// and `Platform.isAndroid` are both false in a unit test, which is why the
// function takes `ios` rather than reading `Platform`. It does NOT call
// `writeWorkoutData`, and it cannot see the plugin's per-platform allow-lists
// or its native maps — so the platform facts asserted below were read out of
// the installed `health` 12.2.1 by hand, and a package upgrade that moved them
// would leave this suite green. Re-read them on a version bump.
//
// The failure being defended against is silent: `writeWorkoutData` throws
// `HealthException` for any type absent from THAT platform's set, before the
// platform channel, so a spelling that exists on one store and not the other
// does not degrade — it drops every workout of that type on the other one.
