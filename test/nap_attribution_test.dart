// HONESTY + DOUBLE-COUNT REGRESSIONS on the nap → sleep-periods seam.
//
// Three separate ways the nap path stated something it did not know:
//
//  1. `_attachNaps` collapsed "judged, and there were no naps" with "could not
//     judge this day at all" — both returned an empty list. `_sleepPeriods`
//     then published `total_asleep_min = mainTstMin` as a CONFIDENT day total
//     on a day whose naps were never assessed, in the very same bundle where
//     `naps.value` is null and `nap_min` was (correctly) left unwritten.
//
//  2. The midnight double-count. Attribution was guarded on the TRAILING edge
//     only (`start < attributionEndSec`, plus the analytics-side backward
//     `unfinished` walk). Nothing guarded the LEADING edge: analytics'
//     `stillAt(0)` short-circuits its discontinuity check at `k == 0`
//     (nap.dart), so the post-midnight remainder of a nap yesterday already
//     emitted whole is re-detected today as a fresh bout at index 0 and
//     credited a second time. Unreachable until `minNapSec` dropped to 15 min.
//
//  3. The leading-edge guard must NOT fire when the record only starts hours
//     into the day: yesterday's detector broke on that same recording
//     discontinuity and dropped the bout too, so today is its only chance to
//     count it. Dropping it there would trade a double-count for data loss.
