// The two things about the rough-night card that must not regress: the gate
// that decides a night is worth saying anything about, and the fact that
// nobody meets the tag vocabulary before asking for it.
//
// The series below are the REAL 17-day export, `metric_series` verbatim. It is
// the only honest calibration available: the gate fires zero times on it, and a
// change that makes this file's first test fail has loosened a gate that exists
// to stop the app guessing at somebody's night.
