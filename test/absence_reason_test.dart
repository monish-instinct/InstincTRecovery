// A SCREEN MAY ONLY STATE A CAUSE THE DATA ACTUALLY GAVE IT.

// `whyFromNote` is the one place a machine note becomes a sentence, so it is
// also the one place a guess could re-enter. The measured failure it exists to
// stop: the Strain screen printed "it needs a resting heart rate from a scored
// night and a day the band was on your wrist" on a day with a scored night
// (RHR 56.8) and 89 % wear, and the Zones screen offered "Add your age in
// Profile" to a profile whose age was set.
//
// The contract in one line: a note it understands becomes a sentence, a note it
// does not becomes NULL — never a paraphrase, never the raw token on screen.
