// The 3-day raw retention only ever ran behind `if (scope.fullHistory)` — i.e.
// only on a manual "Re-analyze data". An ordinary install never pruned, and
// `decoded_onehz` + `decoded_rr` grew ~12 MB/day forever. On top of that the
// guard was all-or-nothing: one day stuck `partial` (which `dayResultIds`
// excludes and which is deliberately never finalized by age) latched pruning
// off for every older day too.
//
// Both halves are asserted here: the cutoff decision as a pure function, and
// the CALL SITE, because the whole bug was a call site sitting under the wrong
// `if` while the function it called was perfectly correct.
