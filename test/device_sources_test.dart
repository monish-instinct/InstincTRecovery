// THE SOURCES SCREEN, once a sensor can be paired.
//
// What is pinned here is the set of claims the screen makes ABOUT a paired
// sensor, because every one of them was true of the band and is false of a
// strap:
//
//   * a sensor is not a band. `isBand` gates the "No band is paired" card, the
//     rename/find/battery controls, and `unpair()`. A strap satisfying it
//     would have taken that card off the screen of someone whose sleep,
//     recovery and temperature are all still abstaining — and pointed a
//     chest strap's Forget button at the WHOOP.
//   * EXPERIMENTAL has to reach it. The label exists for exactly the bands
//     nobody here has held, and it used to be gated on `isBand`, which is the
//     one flag a sensor does not have.
//   * "Reporting steps" is the phone's sentence. A sensor whose tier cannot be
//     named falls back to the phone's rung, and the state line must not
//     inherit the phone's words with it.
