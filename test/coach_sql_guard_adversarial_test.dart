// ADVERSARIAL suite for the coach's read-only SQL guard.
//
// The guard is the boundary between on-device health data and a third-party
// LLM endpoint: anything it lets through is serialized into a prompt and
// leaves the device. It is an ALLOW-LIST (only the v_* coach views and CTEs
// declared in the same statement may appear in a table position), so a table
// added to the schema tomorrow is closed by default.
//
// Every case below is an escape attempt. The first one is a verified working
// exploit against the previous FROM/JOIN-only regex: a comma-separated
// implicit cross-join whose SECOND member (on-device GPS coordinates) was
// never examined at all.
