// The HOST for a paired NO1-family band (TLW64 or F1): connect to its stored
// remote id, drive [Tlw64Adapter] over the link, bank what comes back,

// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6). The registry entry stays
// EXPERIMENTAL, `Tlw64Adapter.signals` stays `const {}`, and nothing this
// file writes becomes a number — every row it commits carries a non-null
// `source`.
//
// THIN COUSIN OF `dafit_link.dart`, MINUS THE HANDSHAKE. There is no pairing
// key and no cursor to hold, and unlike DaFit's family this one has no
// documented "skip this and the battery drains" behaviour to reproduce — see
// `tlw64.dart`'s own header on why nothing is ever written. So this is a
// plain bounded listen window: connect, catch whatever the band sends on its
// own, tear down.
