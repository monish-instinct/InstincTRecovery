// The HOST for a paired Coros watch: connect, pull a battery/identity status
// and whatever heart rate arrives during a bounded window, bank it,
// disconnect.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6). `CorosAdapter.signals`
// covers only the generic HR parse, and `coros` is absent from
// `kDerivableSources` — see `adapters/coros.dart`'s own header.
//
// WHY A BOUNDED WINDOW, NOT FETCH-BY-CURSOR OR ARM/DISARM. Same reasoning as
// `dafit_link.dart`: this watch is continuously worn, not a workout-scoped
// strap, and there is no stored-history request this project decodes and no
// natural end-of-session signal — so a periodic background `sync()` (connect
// briefly, read status, catch a few HR samples, disconnect) is the right
// cadence, and a fixed window is the honest floor for it.
