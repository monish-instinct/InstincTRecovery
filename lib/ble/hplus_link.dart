// The HOST for a paired HPlus-family band: connect, run [HPlusAdapter] over
// the link for one bounded collection window, bank what comes back,
// disconnect.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6). The registry entry stays
// EXPERIMENTAL, `HPlusAdapter.signals` stays `const {}`, and nothing this
// file writes becomes a number: it banks battery and firmware notes plus raw
// frames only, never a `NeutralSample`.
//
// CONNECT-ON-DEMAND, SYNC TRIGGERED EXPLICITLY — the same shape as
// `oura_link.dart`'s one-shot `sync()`, not `hrs_link.dart`'s workout-armed
// session: this is a continuously-worn band, not a chest-strap-for-a-workout
// accessory. But unlike the ring, it has no fetch-by-cursor history to drain
// either — every notification is a live reading, not a flash record — so
// there is no cursor and no anchor to persist between connections. A sync
// connects, gives the band [collectFor] to answer the init sequence and
// stream, then tears the link down.
//
// NO PAIRING KEY, EITHER. Unlike the ring and the Mi Band, this wire has no
// auth handshake — pairing is the plain notify-class flow
// `HrsLink.pairNotifySensor` already runs for every unauthenticated sensor —
// so there is no secret to store, drop, or clean up on forgetting. But the
// LIVE SESSION is owned by this file's own `HPlusLink.instance`, not by
// `HrsLink.instance`'s chest-strap session, so `HrsLink.forgetDevice` still
// carries an explicit branch that stops `instance` here before deleting the
// row — it is only the key-cleanup half of forgetting that this band skips.
