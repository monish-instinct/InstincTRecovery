// The HOST for a paired WearFit-family band: connect, run [WearFitAdapter]
// over the link, bank what comes back, disconnect. One-shot, the same shape
// as [OuraLink.sync] and for the same reason — this band has no continuous
// broadcast to arm the way a workout heart-rate strap does, so a session is
// "connect, ask, listen for a while, tear down" rather than an arm/disarm
// pair.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6). The registry entry stays
// EXPERIMENTAL, `WearFitAdapter.signals` stays `const {}`, and nothing this
// file writes becomes a number.
//
// NO PAIRING KEY, NO CURSOR, NO ANCHOR — the three things `oura_link.dart`
// has to hold that this file genuinely does not: this family needs no key
// exchange, keeps no fetch-by-range history to resume, and every frame is
// stamped on arrival rather than against a device clock this build reads
// back. That is what makes this file the smaller of the two, not an
// oversight relative to it.
