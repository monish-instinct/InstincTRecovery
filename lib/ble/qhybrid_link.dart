// Fossil/Skagen Q Hybrid: pairing IS the one session this band gets, and
// [QHybridLink.sync] is that same session re-run — there is no cursor, no
// history, and no arm/disarm pair, only "hold the link open a bounded window
// and bank whatever the watch sends".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A heart-rate strap is driven by `HrsLink.arm()`,
// which a workout starts and stops. Oura has its own background sync,
// re-runnable from the ring's own page (`OuraLink`). This band has neither —
// nothing derives from it (`QHybridAdapter.signals` is empty) so there is no
// workout to arm it for, and no ongoing number to keep fresh so there is
// nothing to "sync" in the fetch-by-cursor sense. Writing only the `device`
// row (what `HrsLink.pairNotifySensor` does on its own) would leave
// `QHybridAdapter` undriven from the moment that row exists: `BandHost` never
// archives a byte without a `buildArchive` callback (`adapters/host.dart`'s
// own `_bufferArchive`), and nothing else in this app ever constructs a
// `BandHost` for this adapter. So pairing has to run a session, and that same
// session has to be re-runnable — the raw bytes a future decoder might want
// are worth more than one 10-second window right after pairing.
//
// BEST-EFFORT, AND BOUNDED. [pairQHybrid] returns as soon as the `device` row
// is written — the same promise `pairNotifySensor` already makes elsewhere —
// and the session that follows cannot fail that promise: nothing here can
// un-pair a device that answered a moment ago. Every session is capped at
// [_kSessionWindow]; an unbounded live link nobody is watching a spinner for
// is a battery cost and a scan/connect fight with the primary band, the same
// reason `HrsLink` disarms the moment a workout ends.
