// The HOST for Bangle.js (or any generic Nordic-UART device): hold the
// paired row, connect, drive [BangleJsAdapter] over the link for a bounded
// window, bank whatever raw bytes arrive, disconnect.
//
// THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS OURA'S, NOT HrsLink's. A heart-rate strap is a
// live session armed by a workout; this pipe is neither that nor a
// fetch-by-cursor store — `banglejs.dart`'s `run()` just re-emits every
// notification for as long as the link stays open, and there is no
// end-of-history signal because a third-party JS app decides on its own
// schedule whether to print anything at all. So there is nothing to arm for
// a workout and nothing to drain to the end of: a one-shot [sync] connects,
// gives the watch a bounded window to say whatever it is going to say, and
// disconnects. Same host work and order as `oura_link.dart` otherwise: read
// the `device` row, connect by `remote_id`, discover, check
// [GattBandLink.missingCharacteristics], drive `run()`, stop, disconnect.
