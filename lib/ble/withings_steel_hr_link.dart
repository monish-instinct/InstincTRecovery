// The HOST for Withings Steel HR / Activité: read the per-device
// `firstConnect` flag, connect, drive [WithingsSteelHrAdapter] over the
// link, archive verbatim, flip the flag off after the first successful
// session, disconnect.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6). The registry entry stays
// EXPERIMENTAL, `WithingsSteelHrAdapter.signals` stays `const {}`, and
// nothing this file writes becomes a number.
//
// NO KEY, NO CURSOR, NO ANCHOR — the things `oura_link.dart` owns that this
// file does not need. The SHA1 secret is a fixed constant, not a per-device
// credential (see `withings_steel_hr.dart`), and there is no history to
// bookmark: every reassembled message after the handshake is archived, and
// the device is never asked for anything past that.
//
// THE FIRST-CONNECT FLAG is the one piece of session state this band needs
// persisted. It lives in `sync_cursor`, not the `device` row, because it is
// exactly that: a bookmark, one bit wide. It starts true on a fresh pairing
// and flips false only once a session has actually reached the point of
// being considered authenticated (the adapter's own `withings_session_ready`
// note) — never merely because a connection was attempted.
