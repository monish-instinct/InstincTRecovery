// A PineTime as a [BandAdapter]: subscribe to both notify channels, archive
// every frame. Nothing else.
//
// NO AUTH, NO HANDSHAKE, NO WRITE OF ANY KIND. Both characteristics start
// notifying the moment something subscribes to them — there is no bonding
// flag, no bind command, nothing this adapter has to say first.
//
// TWO INDEPENDENT NOTIFY CHANNELS ON TWO DIFFERENT SERVICES, merged into one
// stream by hand rather than reaching for `package:async`'s `StreamGroup`
// (same call `id115.dart` makes, for the same reason): the step-count
// characteristic on this watch's own motion service, and the standard SIG
// heart-rate measurement characteristic [kBleHrs] also answers on.
//
// STEP COUNT AND HEART RATE ARE BOTH READABLE HERE, and neither is decoded
// (ASSUMPTIONS R6): nobody on this project owns one, so nothing is claimed
// until a decoder exists and a real capture has met it. Declaring a signal
// off the heart-rate characteristic the way `ble_hrs.dart` does would need
// its own cross-confirmed capture on THIS firmware, not a borrowed decoder —
// a frame that parses does not mean this watch's clock, contact-sensing or
// units agree with the strap that decoder was proven against.
