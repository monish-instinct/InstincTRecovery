// The Oura ring as a [BandAdapter]: authenticate, drain its history by cursor,
// bank every byte, decode only what has been proven.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE, and unlike `ble_hrs` there is not even a
// public specification to fall back on. It ships EXPERIMENTAL (ASSUMPTIONS R6),
// its rows carry a non-null `source` and `kDerivableSources` does not contain
// it, so nothing it writes can become a number until the owner has held a ring
// in his own hands. That is correct behaviour for an uncalibrated decoder, not
// a limitation to work around.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE OPPOSITE SHAPE TO gen4, and why the seam fits it. gen4's
// offload is TRIM-ON-ACK: the band deletes flash when the host says so, the
// handshake has three wire outcomes, and the decision to trim depends on
// whether the HOST's durable commit landed (ASSUMPTIONS G1-G4 — which is why
// gen4 is not behind this seam). Oura's is FETCH-BY-CURSOR: the ring never
// deletes anything on our say-so, there is no acknowledgement in the protocol
// at all, and the host's only state is a bookmark. Re-reading a range is
// idempotent — 48.5% of our own capture is the same records delivered
// twice, and `decoded_onehz` is keyed `(device_id, ts_ms)` with REPLACE, so a
// re-read overwrites rather than duplicates.
//
// That is exactly the "fetch-by-range: `confirm()` advances the adapter's own
// cursor" row in [OffloadCheckpoint]'s own table, and this file is the first
// implementation of it. The ordering still holds and still means something: the
// cursor does not move until the host has committed, so an interrupted sync
// re-reads rather than skips.
//
// PAIRING EVICTS THE OURA APP, AND IT IS A PRECONDITION RATHER THAN A SIDE
// EFFECT. The ring holds exactly one 16-byte key and will only accept a new one
// while it is FACTORY RESET — so a ring that is currently onboarded to Oura's
// app cannot be paired here at all until the owner factory-resets it, which is
// what removes it from that app. There is no state in which both work. Any
// pairing UI must say that before the user commits, not after.
//
// THE KEY IS OURS AND IT NEVER LEAVES THE PHONE. It is generated locally, there
// is no vendor server anywhere in the handshake and no Oura account is needed —
// which is the whole reason this band is not declined the way a vendor-issued
// pairing token would be. Losing it costs another factory reset, nothing more.
