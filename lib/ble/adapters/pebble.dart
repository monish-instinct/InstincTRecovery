// The Pebble 2 / Pebble 2 SE smartwatch as a [BandAdapter]: connect, and bank
// raw bytes off PPoGATT ("Pebble Protocol over GATT"), the reliable
// byte-transport underneath everything the watch says.
//
// SCOPE IS PPoGATT ONLY, DELIBERATELY. There is no inner Pebble-Protocol frame
// (2-byte length + 2-byte endpoint ID) reassembled here — every de-serialed
// chunk is banked verbatim to `raw_archive`, exactly how `oura.dart` banks
// undecoded event bytes today. Without answering the watch's own handshake at
// that inner layer (endpoint 17, PHONE_VERSION), the watch never settles into
// an app-visible "connected" state and keeps sending the reset/renegotiation
// command below — which this file answers correctly, so the transport stays
// alive, but nothing past it is decoded. That is a known ceiling, not a bug:
// `signals` is empty, so nothing downstream is waiting on a live session.
//
// WIRED via `pebble_link.dart`'s `PebbleLink`, not `HrsLink`. Registering
// [kPebble] in `kBandRegistry` makes PAIRING generic —
// `HrsLink.pairNotifySensor` validates the characteristics and writes the
// `device` row, same as a chest strap — but `HrsLink.arm()` is hardcoded to
// `kBleHrsAdapter` and workout-scoped, so it never drives this adapter.
// `PebbleLink.sync()` does instead: a periodic connect-drain-disconnect over
// a bounded wall-clock window (a watch on the wrist is not a chest strap),
// called from the profile devices screen's sync affordance and the headless
// background pass. `pebble_adapter_test.dart` proves the transport state
// machine and `pebble_link_test.dart` proves a banked frame actually reaches
// `raw_archive`.
//
// ONLY PEBBLE 2 / PEBBLE 2 SE. Every older model runs Bluetooth Classic SPP as
// its primary channel, and even its BLE path requires the phone to also stand
// up a local GATT SERVER — a second, peripheral-role identity this host does
// not have. Pebble 2 / Pebble 2 SE are BLE-only and pure client: connect,
// discover, subscribe, write. Nothing else is reachable from this stack.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns a Pebble.
// Everything below is the documented GATT layout and the fixed control bytes
// the transport requires, verified by the fixtures in
// `test/adapters/pebble_adapter_test.dart` and the compiler. It ships
// EXPERIMENTAL (ASSUMPTIONS R6): `signals` is empty and `kAdapterSignals`
// carries nothing for `'pebble'`, so no card can go looking for a number this
// adapter never claims.
