// Mi Band 2, 3 and 4 — the shared "Huami legacy" GATT protocol — as a
// [BandAdapter].
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE, same as every other notify-class band on
// this seam. It ships EXPERIMENTAL (ASSUMPTIONS R6): [signals] is `const {}`,
// exactly like [kOura] and [kBleHrs], and `kDerivableSources` does not name
// it. It may pair, connect and bank raw bytes; nothing here can become a
// metric until the owner has held one.
//
// THE HANDSHAKE IS A LOCALLY-GENERATED SECRET, not a vendor one. The band
// holds exactly one 16-byte key at a time and only accepts a NEW one while it
// has none — a factory-reset or never-paired unit. A band already bound to
// another key refuses or silently ignores the install, same shape as the
// Oura ring's own precondition; see `miband_link.dart` for the pairing-side
// wording.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT DECODE HEART RATE EVEN THOUGH IT COULD. `ble_hrs.dart`
// already has a verified decoder for the exact bytes the standard HR
// characteristic carries, and reusing it here would be one line. Declined for
// v1 on purpose: nobody has confirmed which variant of this family is on the
// other end of a given pairing (plain Mi Band 2 has no HR sensor at all), and
// stamping a decoded reading under a band nobody has actually touched is the
// declared-but-unverified mistake the signals contract exists to prevent.
// Battery and step bytes get the same treatment for the same reason — every
// optional channel is archived verbatim, undecoded, never turned into a
// [BandNote].
//
// WHY THIS NEVER TOUCHES HISTORY. Fetching and clearing the band's stored
// activity data is a real, stateful, multi-step protocol with its own record
// layout — decodable in principle, but building a state machine this project
// cannot verify for a device with zero decoded metrics buys nothing today.
// This file never writes to that channel, so the band's flash is left
// completely alone: no [OffloadCheckpoint] is ever emitted.
