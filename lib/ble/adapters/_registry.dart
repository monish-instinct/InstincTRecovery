// The const table of bands this build can see.
//
// Dart AOT has no runtime code loading, no `dart:mirrors`, and lazy static
// initialisation defeats import-for-side-effects registration (ASSUMPTIONS
// E4), so this is a hand-maintained `const` list. Adding a band is a source
// edit here and nothing else. Revisit past ~50 entries.
//
// SCOPE — this file is the IDENTITY half only. The session seam now exists in
// `adapter.dart` (`BandAdapter` / `BandLink` / `BandEvent`) and an adapter
// points BACK at its entry here rather than restating a service UUID that the
// iOS AccessorySetupKit plist is generated from. Two declarations of one UUID
// is one declaration too many.
//
// This file holds the facts `ble_engine.dart` used to hardcode:
//
//   • which service UUIDs the scan filters on            (D1)
//   • which characteristics a link must expose to connect (D2)
//   • where the inner-record fields sit                   (D3)
//
// `run(BandLink)`, `BandEvent` and `InputSignal` live in `adapter.dart` /
// `signals.dart`. There are — per MULTIBAND_PLAN §3.1 — no capability
// booleans here or there, ever: an adapter declares the INPUT signals a device
// physically emits, never a `supportsX()` claim about our own features.
//
// WHAT THE FIRST NON-WHOOP ENTRY PROVED (D10, the `0x180D` strap below).
// The identity half of this type held: id, label, service UUID and
// `requiredCharacteristics` describe a generic heart-rate strap exactly, and
// `requiredCharacteristics` had already been made a field for precisely this.
// Two halves did NOT hold, and both are recorded here rather than papered over:
//
//   1. The WIRE half is WHOOP-shaped by construction. [GattProfile] is six
//      named command/notify characteristics and [BandProfile] is a framed
//      envelope over a CLOSED `DeviceType {gen4, gen5}` enum — neither can
//      express one service with one notify characteristic and no envelope, and
//      `protocol` is SEALED so neither can be widened there. So both are
//      NULLABLE now: null means "not a framed WHOOP-family band", and
//      [isFramed] is the predicate every WHOOP-only consumer filters on.
//   2. There was no SESSION half at all — a [BandEntry] DESCRIBES a band, it
//      cannot DRIVE one. CLOSED by `adapter.dart`: the `0x180D` strap is now a
//      `BandAdapter` whose whole session is one `run(BandLink)`, and this
//      entry is what that adapter points at for its identity. gen4 and gen5
//      still run through `ble_engine._doConnect`; moving them behind the seam
//      is the next wave, and until then `isFramed` remains the predicate that
//      tells the two worlds apart.

/// construct (`whoop_gen4.dart`) and there is no such instance at this
/// static, top-level scope; `OuraAdapter` needs a pairing key. Every adapter's
/// `signals` getter is a plain literal with no computed dependency, so this
/// maps straight to the declared signals instead of a constructed instance —
/// KEPT IN SYNC BY HAND with `whoop_gen4.dart`'s `kWhoopGen4Signals`,
/// `ble_hrs.dart`'s `BleHrsAdapter.signals`, `oura.dart`'s
/// `OuraAdapter.signals`, `ultrahuman.dart`'s `UltrahumanAdapter.signals`,
/// `o2ring.dart`'s `O2RingAdapter.signals`,

/// `RingConnAdapter.signals`, `dt78.dart`'s `Dt78Adapter.signals` and
/// `pinetime.dart`'s `PineTimeAdapter.signals`, since importing those back
/// into this file (each of which already imports THIS file for its
/// `BandEntry`) would be a needless import cycle for a handful of lines of
/// data.
///
/// gen5 reuses gen4's map: `kWhoopGen5`'s own doc comment states "same inner
