// The Wellue O2Ring as a [BandAdapter]: connect, ask for device info, bank
// every byte, decode nothing physiological.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns one (ASSUMPTIONS
// R6), so it ships EXPERIMENTAL, `signals` stays `const {}`, and
// `kDerivableSources` does not contain it — exactly the same posture as
// `oura.dart`, for the same reason.
//
// WHY THIS IS SO MUCH SHORTER THAN `oura.dart`. There is no key, no nonce, no
// challenge-response — `protocol`'s own header explains why the file
// commands that would drain a stored recording are not implemented at all, so
// what is left is one request/reply round trip with no session state to carry
// between calls. INFO's reply is JSON, so parsing it is not a guess about a
// bit-packed layout the way Oura's undecoded events are — but the numbers it
// carries are device metadata (battery, model, serial, file names), never a
// physiological reading, so none of it is a [NeutralSample] and none of it is
// declared in [signals].
//
// EVERY NOTIFICATION IS ARCHIVED VERBATIM regardless of whether this file
// could parse it, same as Oura's undecoded events (owner rulings R1-R3): a
// byte this session could not make sense of today is not a byte to discard.
