// Any standard Bluetooth heart-rate sensor — the SIG's Heart Rate Service
// (0x180D) — as a [BandAdapter].
//
// This is the HOSTILE case for a WHOOP-shaped seam, and that is exactly why it
// is the first one expressed in it: no envelope, no CRC, one notify
// characteristic, no commands, no clock, no flash and therefore no offload. If
// it needed a special case anywhere in `adapter.dart`, the seam would be wrong.
// It did not.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns a strap and
// `flutter_blue_plus` has no simulator path, so everything below is verified by
// the Bluetooth SIG's Heart Rate Service 1.0 layout, by the fixtures in
// `test/hrs_link_test.dart`, and by the compiler. It ships EXPERIMENTAL
// (ASSUMPTIONS R6) until he owns one and cross-confirms it.
