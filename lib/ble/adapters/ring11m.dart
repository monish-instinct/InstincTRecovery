// A generic white-label smart ring ("R11M"/"R10M", also "TK5") as a
// [BandAdapter]: negotiate over the plain request/response command channel,
// correctly speak the block-ack/nack sub-protocol its history transfer uses,
// bank every frame verbatim, decode nothing physiological.
//
// NOT the Colmi R11/R12 — a different, unrelated product on a different
// protocol. NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE (ASSUMPTIONS R6): it ships
// EXPERIMENTAL, `signals` stays `const {}`, and this id is absent from
// `kDerivableSources` — nothing this file writes can become a number until
// someone has held one.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT REQUEST HISTORY BY TYPE. `protocol`'s `ring11m.dart`
// pins the outer frame, the negotiation replies, and the block terminator —
// each checked against a real captured example or an exact byte sequence.
// What it deliberately has no builder for is the per-history-type REQUEST
// command ("query key") that starts a steps/sleep/HR/etc. transfer: no
// concrete byte value for one was available to check against a real frame,
// and inventing one is exactly the guess this project's whole discipline
// exists to refuse. So this session never asks the ring for a specific
// history type. What it DOES do, and does correctly: recognise ANY
// group-0x05 block the ring sends — pushed on its own, or later once a real
// request command is confirmed and this file is widened — validate its CRC,
// ack or nack it so the ring's own state machine keeps moving instead of
// stalling, and archive every byte regardless.
//
// WHY A BOUNDED WINDOW, LIKE THE DAFIT/MOYOUNG FAMILY AND NOT OURA'S
// `bytesLeft == 0`. There is no per-type request to exhaust and therefore no
// natural end-of-drain signal this file can read — the ring's own auto-sync
// behaviour, if it has one, is exactly what it decides on its own. A fixed
// window is the honest floor: long enough to run the negotiation and catch
// anything the ring sends during it, bounded so a background sync slot ends.
