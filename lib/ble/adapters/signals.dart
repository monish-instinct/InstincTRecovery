// What a band physically EMITS. Never what OpenStrap can compute from it.
//
// This is the whole reason the seam is shaped the way it is. A capability
// boolean (`supportsSpo2()`) names an OUTPUT: metric N+1 widens the interface
// and every implementation becomes a breaking change, so the blast radius of a
// new feature is the device count. That is how Gadgetbridge's
// `DeviceCoordinator` reached 1,092 lines, 168 methods and ~61 `supportsXxx()`
// booleans while its device count went 270 -> 511.
//
// A signal names an INPUT — a physical fact that was true before anyone
// conceived the metric. A Polar H10 emits RR intervals whether or not we have
// written a respiratory-rate function. Blast radius of a new metric: one
// analytics function and one card. ZERO adapters, forever.
//
// The consequence is free and it is the reason there are no UI conditionals:
// an undeclared signal produces no substrate column, so the metric returns
// absent and the card deletes itself through the absence contract that already
// exists.
//
// DO NOT add a member for something we compute. `readiness`, `sleepScore` and
// `hrv` are outputs. If you are about to add one, you want a metric, not a
// signal.
