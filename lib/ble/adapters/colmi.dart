// Colmi smart ring family as a [BandAdapter]: connect, walk the day-cursor
// history commands, bank every reply byte, decode nothing into a signal.
//
// THE WIRE. A fixed 16-byte frame with no envelope beyond itself: byte 0 is
// the command id, bytes 1-14 are the command's own zero-padded payload, byte
// 15 is the low byte of the sum of bytes 0-14. No CRC beyond that one-byte
// sum, no sequence numbers, no session state carried across writes except
// whatever the ring itself buffers. Every reply — including an unprompted
// battery push — arrives on the notify characteristic tagged by the same
// command id it went out under.
//
// NO HANDSHAKE OF ANY KIND. No pairing key, no nonce, no challenge-response,
// no bonding requirement this protocol itself asks for. Connect, discover,
// subscribe, start writing — the same honest floor as `ble_hrs.dart`'s
// no-handshake case, except this band also has a command channel.
//
// SERVICE A ONLY. A second GATT service on the same ring (sleep + SpO2 "big
// data") is length-prefixed and reassembles across several notify frames —
// real reassembly logic this adapter does not implement, and deliberately: it
// is the one piece of this protocol with real complexity, and nothing derives
// from any of this ring's bytes yet regardless. Deferred to a later PR.
//
// REQUEST-PAYLOAD ASSUMPTIONS, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. The day-cursor walks
// below are a direct transcription of what is known: a day offset, a
// 5-byte little-endian timestamp alongside it for the HR walk specifically,
// and BCD-encoded date bytes for the activity walk. The exact BYTE POSITIONS
// within a payload are this file's own reasonable reading of that, not an
// independently confirmed fact — getting one wrong costs a request the ring
// answers with nothing, never a corrupted write, since every command here is
// a read request and nothing in this protocol acknowledges or deletes on our
// say-so. The battery reply's value byte (payload[0], i.e. frame byte 1) is
// the same kind of reasonable-not-confirmed reading. A real capture is what
// would upgrade any of this from "a request that may return data" to a
// decoder — which is exactly why none of it is decoded into a signal.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL, and it stays that way: nobody on this project owns a Colmi
// ring, so not a byte of this path has met hardware (ASSUMPTIONS R6).
// `signals` is `const {}`, matching `kOura`'s empty map — not `hrSparse` even
// though the ring plainly measures heart rate, because nothing here has
// checked a decode against real bytes. Every frame that answers the command
// it was requested under is archived verbatim; nothing is translated into
// `decoded_onehz` or any other analytics-facing column. A frame that does not
// answer the command being awaited — cross-talk, or a truncated notification
// — is dropped and logged rather than banked: this adapter's per-command
// buffer has nowhere honest to file a reply that isn't one.
