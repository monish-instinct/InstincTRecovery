// DT78 / DT92 / DT66 and the wider tail of WearFit-2.0-compatible OEM clones,
// as a [BandAdapter].
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns one of these
// watches, so only the envelope itself and the two report codes with a real
// worked byte example — battery and device info — are read at all, and
// neither becomes anything more than a [BandNote]. Every frame this watch
// sends — the health bundle, steps, sleep, the two connect-event pushes — is
// banked to `raw_archive` verbatim and none of it is decoded. It ships
// EXPERIMENTAL (ASSUMPTIONS R6), `signals` is `const {}`, and it is excluded
// from `kDerivableSources`: nothing here can become a number until someone
// has held one of these to cross-check a decode against.
//
// NO HANDSHAKE. There is no pairing key, no nonce, no challenge/response and
// no bonding requirement anywhere in this protocol — the whole of what a
// working client does after service discovery is request an MTU and enable
// notifications, both of which happen above this seam. This file's [run]
// starts polling the moment it is subscribed.
//
// THE FRAME, transcribed from the format's own worked examples:
//
//   AB 00 [len] FF [cmd] [mode] [args...]
//
// `len` is a u8 counting every byte from the `FF` marker to the end of the
// frame inclusive — the only integrity signal this format has, since there is
// no checksum or CRC anywhere in it. Nothing states that one GATT
// notification carries exactly one frame, so [_Dt78Reader] buffers across
// notifications and only emits once a declared length has actually arrived.
//
// WRITE TYPE. Both reference clients write host->watch without response
// (Android sets `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE` explicitly), while this repo's
// shared link write is with-response by construction (`gatt_link.dart`) —
// that is what triggers WHOOP's bonding, and it is untested here against a
// real DT78 characteristic that may not expose the with-response property.
// Left as-is rather than widening the shared link for one unverified band;
// worth checking against real hardware before this ships past EXPERIMENTAL.
