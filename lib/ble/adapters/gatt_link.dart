// The real [BandLink]: `flutter_blue_plus` on one side, an adapter on the
// other.
//
// This file is HOST PLUMBING that happens to live in `adapters/` because
// MULTIBAND_PLAN §3.6 makes this directory the only place `protocol` may be
// imported, and the dangerous-opcode block below needs protocol's opcode
// tables. A contributor writing an adapter reads `adapter.dart` and their own
// `<id>.dart` and never this.
//
// It deliberately does NOT do: discovery, connect, bond, MTU negotiation,
// connection priority, CoreBluetooth restoration, AccessorySetupKit
// provisioning, or the process-wide band lock. Those are per-PLATFORM and
// per-APP concerns owned above the seam; a link is handed the services of an
// already-connected peripheral and does nothing but move bytes.
