// RingConn (Gen 2 / Gen 2 Air / Gen 3) as a [BandAdapter]: authenticate
// against the ring's own BLE MAC, drain both history channels, bank every
// frame verbatim, decode nothing.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns a ring (owner
// ruling R6), so not one byte of this path has been exercised against one. It
// ships EXPERIMENTAL, `signals` stays `const {}`, and nothing this file writes
// becomes a number: its rows carry a non-null `source`, and every derive/export
// read filters `source IS NULL`. That is correct behaviour for an uncalibrated
// decoder, not a limitation to route around.
//
// THE SHAPE IS SIMPLER THAN OURA'S, and for a real reason rather than an
// oversight: the ring tracks its own resume position per channel, so unlike
// `OuraAdapter` this file holds no pairing key, no drain cursor and no time
// anchor. Every connection opens both channels at "now" — that is the same
// behaviour the ring's own vendor app exercises, and it is exactly why there
// is a known limitation to state rather than hide: the ring appears to share
// ONE resume pointer per channel across every bonded client, so whichever
// side (us or the vendor app) opens at "now" first drains the backlog and
// leaves the other side an empty pass. Nothing is lost permanently — the
// ring's own buffer is measured in days — but a sync run right after the
// vendor app's own sync can come back looking emptier than expected.
//
// THE AUTH HANDSHAKE IS A KEYED HASH, NOT VENDOR ENCRYPTION. SM3 is a
// published algorithm (`ringconn.dart` in the protocol package) computed over
// the ring's own BLE MAC — read openly off the standard System ID
// characteristic — and a single-byte challenge. There is no vendor secret, no
// cloud key and nothing installed on the ring; the whole handshake runs fresh
// on every connection with nothing persisted host-side.
//
// WHAT STAYS EXPERIMENTAL, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GAP TO CLOSE HERE: the bulk
// pages this file drains (`0x47` PPG/optical, `0x4c` activity/sleep) carry
// per-field layouts — HR, HRV, SpO2, respiratory rate, step counts — that are
// well-characterised on paper but unverified on real hardware. `run()` reads
// only the STRUCTURAL envelope: the reply tag, the page's remaining-count
// byte, and the fixed record length needed to slice a page and walk the
// stream — never a byte inside a record. Every record, decoded or not, is
// archived verbatim; a future decoder finds them there once someone owns a
// ring to check one against.
