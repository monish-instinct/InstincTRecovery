// A Casio G-Shock / current-generation Casio smartwatch, speaking the 2C/2D
// "all-features" GATT scheme, as a [BandAdapter].
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns a Casio watch,
// so every byte below is verified by the compiler and by the fixtures in
// `test/adapters/casio_adapter_test.dart`, never by a real device. It ships
// EXPERIMENTAL (ASSUMPTIONS R6): `signals` is `const {}` and `kAdapterSignals`
// carries no entry for it beyond the empty map, exactly like `kOura` and
// `kBleHrs`.
//
// THE WIRE SHAPE IS THE SIMPLEST ONE THIS SEAM HAS SEEN. One request
// characteristic, one response characteristic, no envelope, no CRC, no
// sequence counter, and no stored history to drain — closer to a plain notify
// sensor than to anything WHOOP-shaped. The host writes a one-byte feature tag
// and the watch answers on notify with `[featureTag, ...payload]`; there is
// nothing to ACK and nothing to trim.
//
// WHAT THIS SESSION DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It writes a small, fixed set of
// harmless, read-only feature tags — version info, app info, watch name,
// module id, BLE features — and banks every reply verbatim. It never writes
// the clock, an alarm, a reminder or any other setting: those are
// control-plane writes with device-specific side effects, and a pairs-only
// adapter has no business making them. No field of any reply is decoded; a
// module-id BYTE COUNT is the one thing surfaced as a [BandNote], because it
// is pure device metadata (not a measurement) and unambiguous without a
// decoder.
