// THE HOST for every adapter-driven session (M1 spec §10).
//
// ONE `BandEvent` switch lives here. Before this file there were two,
// hand-written and drifting apart: `hrs_link._onEvent` and
// `oura_link._onEvent`. After the M1 rewire (see hrs_link.dart, oura_link.dart)
// there is exactly one, and `test/scan_lock_entry_points_test.dart`'s
// structural family enforces it.
//
// WHAT THIS OWNS: the `ephemeral` refusal (never persist a live batch), the
// per-second write buffer + flush cadence, commit-then-confirm ordering,
// `BandNote` routing, and the device_id / device_family / source stamping.
//
// NOT WIRED IN M1: a per-device `RecordGate` seed. The spec proposed one;
// wiring it rejected `test/hrs_link_test.dart`'s own fixture rows (their
// fixed timestamps drift into "the future" relative to whatever day the
// suite runs, and the gate's `wallNow + 1 day` ceiling refuses them), and
// neither adapter needs it today (HRS is live-only; Oura already bounds its
// own seconds — see `_admitSample`). See host.dart's own doc on
// `_admitSample` for the finding.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT OWN, named so nobody moves it here: the radio
// (`GattBandLink` stays in `gatt_link.dart`; connect/bond/MTU/discovery stay
// with whoever owns the peripheral); pairing and keys (stay in `oura_link.dart`
// — one band's credential lifecycle, nothing shared to extract); the Oura time
// anchor (`OuraAdapter._anchorUnixFor` stays the one implementation of "which
// second is this decisecond" — this host gains no origin); gen4's drain
// policy (`DrainController` and friends stay gen4's; M2 moves them into the
// adapter, never into the host).
