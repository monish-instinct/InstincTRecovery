// The SESSION seam: what it takes to DRIVE a band, not merely describe one.
//
// `_registry.dart` gave three bands a shared identity — id, label, service
// UUID, required characteristics. What it could not give them was shared
// PLUMBING: SET_CLOCK, INIT, the drain, `RecordGate`, the batch ACK and the
// liveness fuse were all hardcoded in `ble_engine._doConnect`, so a band that
// did not speak that exact sequence still needed ~200 lines of its own. This
// file is the interface that closes that gap (MULTIBAND_PLAN §3.1).
//
// FIVE MEMBERS, and the shape of each one is a decision with a reason:
//
//  * No separate `handshake()`. `run()` is `async*`, so authentication is
//    simply the statements before the first `yield`. A second lifecycle method
//    is a second place to get the ordering wrong.
//  * No `tier` field on an event. Tier is a property of a DERIVATION and
//    `Metric.tier` already carries it; an adapter claiming a tier would be
//    claiming something about analytics it cannot know.
//  * No capability booleans, EVER. See `signals.dart`.
//  * Offload is ONE callback. Four models reduce to "the host has committed
//    durably; now do the band-specific thing that lets the band forget".
//  * `ephemeral` exists because a live frame must never reach `raw_records`.
//
// DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED — named here so nobody adds them speculatively:
// typed resumption cursors; progress/ETA models; gap detection and partial
// re-request (gen4-specific policy, which lives INSIDE the gen4 adapter, not
// at the seam); OTA; a cross-band command abstraction; per-sample cross-device
// fusion; and any waveform channel.
//
// WHAT A CONTRIBUTOR NEVER TOUCHES, and cannot reach from here: the
// `flutter_blue_plus` API, bonding, CoreBluetooth restoration, iOS
// AccessorySetupKit provisioning, Android permission blockers, the
// process-wide band lock, connection priority, MTU negotiation, `sqflite`, any
// schema migration, `kAlgoVersion`, `Substrate`, any analytics function, the
// derivation engine or scheduler, and any widget, card, screen or golden. If a
// change to this file would expose one of those, the change is wrong.
