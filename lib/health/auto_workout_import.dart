// auto_workout_import.dart — opt-in background bring-in of Health workouts.
//
// The manual Import button asks permission ON THE TAP and then reads the
// source's whole shareable window, replacing by uuid (a second pass updates
// rows instead of stacking copies — see HealthWorkoutImporter.sync). That is
// the right shape for a button and the wrong shape for a background job:
// nothing may prompt from a cadence pass, and an unconditional read on every
// drain is exactly the churn the battery audit removed elsewhere.
//
// So auto-import is:
//   • OPT-IN, off by default — same rule as every outbound path in this app.
//     The switch lives next to the manual Import button; turning it ON is a
//     user tap, so THAT is the moment permission may be asked.
//   • NON-PROMPTING thereafter — a cadence pass only reads when the store
//     already granted WORKOUT read (checked without prompting). Until one
//     manual import has been approved, auto-import silently does nothing.
//   • THROTTLED — at most one full-window read per hour (see
//     [kAutoWorkoutImportInterval]); a zero-row read still stamps the
//     attempt, or a store that holds nothing would be re-read on every
//     foreground pass.
//   • BEST-EFFORT — never throws into the caller; failures just leave the
//     manual button as the fallback it always was.
