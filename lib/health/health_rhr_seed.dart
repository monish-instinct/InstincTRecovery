// Seed a SHADOW resting-heart-rate baseline from the phone's health store.
//
// THE PROBLEM. A personal baseline needs nights. A new user has none, so
// readiness — which is a deviation from a personal centre — is honestly blank
// for weeks. Many of those users have two years of resting HR sitting in Apple
// Health from a watch they already wear.
//
// WHAT THIS SHIPS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES.
//   * A BASELINE, NEVER A DAY. No imported night appears on the sleep chart, no
//     readiness is backfilled. Another device's number is on another device's
//     scale — that can inform a personal CENTRE and SPREAD, and it can never be
//     a value the app shows as measured.
//   * RHR ONLY. Not HRV, not respiratory rate. iOS writes SDNN and Android
//     writes RMSSD, and this app's HRV baseline is fed from rmssd: folding
//     SDNN into it gives a new user confidently wrong readiness for their first
//     month, which is worse than the blank it replaced.
//   * A SHADOW, and nothing consumes it. It is written under its own baselines
//     key, read by nobody, and compared against the band's own once the band
//     has 14 nights of its own. If the two disagree wildly the seed is a
//     liability and the feature stops there — that comparison is the point of
//     this pass, not a diagnostic bolted onto a shipped feature.
//
// PROVENANCE. HealthKit's resting HR is Apple's own derived number, computed by
// their algorithm from their sensor. This has every provenance obligation the
// WHOOP importer has: it is a vendor snapshot, and it must be labelled as one
// wherever it ever surfaces.
//
// (Do not quote the ICC 0.92-0.97 agreement figure at anyone about this. That
// is multi-night averaging; single-night agreement is nearer 0.7-0.9.)
