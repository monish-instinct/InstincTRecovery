// Read body metrics from the platform health store into the local profile.
//
// Everything else in lib/health writes OUT. This reads IN, for one reason:
// weight changes, and three things the app computes depend on it — calories
// (Keytel), BMR, and the strain anchors. A profile typed in once at onboarding
// and never touched again quietly gets more wrong every month, and most people
// already keep their weight current somewhere else.
//
// PLATFORM ASYMMETRY, and it is not symmetrical by accident:
//   height + weight — both platforms.
//   sex + date of birth — APPLE ONLY. Health Connect has no characteristic
//   record for either, and the plugin's Android type list does not contain
//   them. Requesting them there is the issue #184 shape all over again, so the
//   requested set is built per platform rather than filtered afterwards.
