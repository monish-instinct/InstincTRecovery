// Read workouts — and, on Apple, their routes — out of the platform health
// store into a table this app does not derive from.
//
// WHAT THIS IS ALLOWED TO BECOME — the line moved once, deliberately, and this
// is where it now sits.
//
// ALLOWED: a list, a map, and a COUNT. An imported workout appears in Workout ›
// History beside the band's own sessions, in date order, with the app or watch
// that recorded it named on the row, and it counts toward "This week". A
// session you did is a session you did, and a history that silently omits your
// Sunday run is wrong in a way a user can see.
//
// REFUSED: weekly load, CTL/ATL/TSB, the day's strain, the personal records,
// and every personal baseline. Not out of caution — there is nothing to put in
// them. Training load here is TRIMP, which is minutes weighted by heart rate,
// and an imported workout arrives with no heart-rate series at all; the only
// way to give it a load number is to invent one from its duration and call it
// measured. The calories and distance the source app recorded are shown as ITS
// numbers, next to its name, and are never summed into ours: two devices'
// calorie models added together is one number neither of them would agree with.
//
// The refusal is structural, not a filter someone has to remember: these rows
// live in their own table (see db.dart `_createImportedWorkout`), so nothing
// that reads `sessions` can reach them by accident. The screen opts a row IN,
// one surface at a time, and each surface that takes one says whose it was.
//
// PLATFORM ASYMMETRY, and it is load-bearing:
//   workouts — both platforms.
//   routes   — APPLE ONLY, and via our own method channel, because the pinned
//              `health` 11.1.1 has no route API at all (the string "route"
//              does not occur anywhere in its lib/, ios/ or android/ sources).
//              Health Connect gates routes behind READ_EXERCISE_ROUTES, a
//              restricted permission needing a Google declaration or a
//              per-route system consent dialog; neither is wired, so Android
//              imports workouts WITHOUT coordinates and the UI says so. A half
//              path that silently returned no points would be indistinguishable
//              from a user who simply never records outdoors.
