// workout_idle.dart — PURE policy: when has an open live workout gone quiet
// for long enough that the user probably forgot to finish it?
//
// The failure this exists for: a session started and never stopped. The band
// keeps recording rest, `startWorkout` refuses every later workout while one
// is open, and the session counts as a live consumer so the full 100 Hz
// streams stay armed all night. Nothing in the app said anything — the first
// sign was Home going bare the next morning.
//
// The policy only ever ASKS. There is deliberately no auto-stop: ending a
// session writes a record only the user can vouch for, and a long stretch at
// resting heart rate is also what yin yoga, a lunch break mid-hike, or a
// phone left on the kitchen counter look like. The watch reports a measured
// quiet stretch and leaves the decision where it belongs.

/// Tracks the trailing quiet stretch of one live session and decides when to
/// ask "Still working out?".
///
/// Fed once per 1 Hz workout tick. A tick is ACTIVE when it carries a real
/// reading (positive bpm) at or above the calorie pipeline's activity gate —
/// the same `Calories.activeGateHr` line that separates a bout from rest, so
/// "quiet" here means exactly "billed as rest there". With no gate (a profile
/// without calorie anchors), intensity cannot be judged and any real reading
/// counts as active: a worn strap is never nudged on a guess, and only
/// absence — off skin, or the link gone — builds the streak.
///
/// Asking is retried: the flagship case is an evening session forgotten
/// overnight, whose first ask lands inside the default 22:00–07:00 quiet
/// window and is dropped by the notification gate. [onTick] keeps returning
/// true every [retryEvery] until the caller reports a presented notification
/// via [confirmFired] — which ends it for good: one nudge per session, ever.
