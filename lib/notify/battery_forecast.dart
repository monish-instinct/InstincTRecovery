// battery_forecast.dart — will the band still be alive when you wake up?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A band that dies at 03:00 does not cost you a battery bar; it costs the whole
// night. Sleep is the one block this app cannot reconstruct from anything else:
// no nocturnal HRV, no sleep stages, no recovery score in the morning, and a
// hole in the rolling baselines that quietly degrades every baseline-relative
// metric for days afterwards. The band already reports battery every few
// minutes and we already persist it (`band_battery`), so the information needed
// to say "charge it now" at dinner time has been sitting on disk unused.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT
// It is not a fuel gauge and it does not model the pack. It answers one narrow
// question — at the rate you have ACTUALLY been discharging over the last few
// hours, where do you land at wake time? — and it abstains loudly the moment
// that question is not answerable. A wrong "you're fine" is worse than silence,
// because silence still lets the user look at the battery number themselves.
//
// ESTIMATOR
// Theil–Sen: the median of all pairwise slopes (Theil 1950; Sen 1968). Chosen
// over least squares because the input is quantised percentage points sampled
// at irregular intervals, so a single stuck or rounded reading drags an OLS fit
// noticeably; the median of slopes ignores it. It also degrades honestly — with
// too few points the median is simply not computed and we abstain.
