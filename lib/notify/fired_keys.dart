// fired_keys.dart — the persistent, cross-isolate "already fired this key" record.
//
// A NotificationEvent's dedupeKey (by convention "$date:$kind") promises the
// event fires at most once. The OS notification id alone does NOT enforce this:
// re-showing the same id only REPLACES the prior post in the shade — it still
// re-alerts (sound/buzz). Since derivation re-runs on every BLE sync, an insight
// whose condition holds all day (e.g. today's low-readiness or irregular-rhythm
// flag) would fire over and over (issue #136). This store makes emit() honour the
// promise: a key that has already fired is skipped until a *new* key comes along.
//
// CROSS-ISOLATE. Derivation ran in TWO isolates when this was written: the
// long-lived foreground pass (kept alive for BLE) and the WorkManager
// background pass (background_derivation.dart, since removed — its tombstone
// explains why). The hardening below stays: the iOS headless/BGTask paths can
// still run emit() from a second isolate, and the failure modes are the same.
// The NotificationCenter lock only orders emits WITHIN one
// isolate; it can't coordinate across them. Three distinct things went wrong
// there, and a same-day key re-fired all day:
//
//   1. Stale read cache. The legacy SharedPreferences instance loads a snapshot
//      once and never re-reads disk. The long-lived foreground isolate loaded
//      prefs before today's key existed, so after the background isolate recorded
//      it, hasFired() still read the stale snapshot as "not fired" → re-alert.
//   2. Lost-update clobber. Keys lived in ONE shared list mutated via
//      read-modify-write (getStringList → add → setStringList). With no
//      cross-process lock, whichever isolate wrote last rewrote the WHOLE list
//      from its own (stale) copy, dropping the other's keys — including a
//      just-recorded one, which then re-fired.
//   3. Check-then-record is not atomic. Even with a fresh read and independent
//      per-key flags, "has it fired?" and "record that it fired" are two separate
//      operations. Both isolates can read false before either writes, and both
//      present. Fresher reads shrink that window; they cannot close it.
//
// (1) and (2) are properties of the storage medium; (3) is a property of the
// PROTOCOL, so the fix is a protocol change: [claim] replaces check-then-record
// with a single atomic operation, backed by SQLite. `INSERT OR IGNORE` against a
// PRIMARY KEY is one statement and writers are serialised, so for a given key
// exactly one caller in the whole process ever wins. That caller — and only it —
// presents. See LocalDb.claimNotifFired.
//
// DEGRADED MODE. If the DB is unusable (not yet open, torn down mid-background
// pass, or absent in a plain unit test), claim falls back to the
// SharedPreferences per-key flags: reload-before-read plus one independent bool
// per key, which still fixes (1) and (2) and leaves only the narrow (3) window.
// The fallback is deliberately NOT "assume already fired" — a broken DB must
// never silently swallow every notification on the device. Every successful
// claim also writes the prefs mirror, so the two stores can't disagree about a
// key that fired while the DB was down.
//
// Reset is automatic: keys are date-prefixed, so tomorrow's "2026-07-27:low_read"
// is a fresh key that fires once. Growth is bounded by the prune pass: dated
// claims older than [retentionDays] are dropped (the dedupe only needs today, so
// a fortnight is ample). Keys without a leading date (e.g. "alarm_fired:<epoch>")
// have no day to expire against and are rare, so they're left alone.
