// device_alerts.dart — turns the band's battery/charging state into OS alerts.
//
// Fed the latest DeviceState on every BLE update (AppState._onEngineState), but
// it is EDGE-TRIGGERED and de-duped, so it fires at most once per real event —
// never on every tick:
//   • Low battery (below the user's threshold — default 15% — not charging):
//     once per drain. Re-arms only after the battery recovers past
//     threshold+10 (hysteresis) or goes back on the charger.
//   • Charging started: once per plug-in, gated by [ChargeAlertPolicy].
//
// THE EDGE STATE IS PERSISTED (issue #179). It used to live only in RAM, which
// is wrong on Android specifically: EdgeApplication pre-warms a Dart engine on
// every process create, and KeepAliveWorker + the START_STICKY foreground
// service mean the process is recreated routinely. Each restart reset
// `_wasCharging` to null and re-armed the low-battery hysteresis, so the next
// replayed chargingOn from the strap's flash backlog buzzed all over again —
// the "repeated 'band is on the charger'" report. Anything that must fire "once
// per real event" cannot key off in-memory state alone here.
//
// Presentation goes through NotificationCenter — the single emitter — NOT
// straight to the plugin. It used to call NotificationService.showDevice, which
// wrote to the plugin directly and so consulted neither the user's quiet hours
// nor their category switch: putting the strap on the charger at 23:30 buzzed
// the phone at Importance.high. It also passed no payload, so the tap did
// nothing. Both are properties of the shared gate, which is why the fix is to
// use it rather than to re-implement it here.
//
// These two alerts keep FIXED OS ids (see NotificationEvent.osId) because this
// file also has to CANCEL the "Charging" card when the puck comes off.
