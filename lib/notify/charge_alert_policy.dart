// charge_alert_policy.dart — decides whether a "charging started" band event is
// NEWS (worth buzzing the user) or NOISE (a backlog replay of something that
// already happened).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #179 — "repeated 'band is on the charger' well after
// the charger was removed"):
//
// The strap buffers its event log in flash and dumps it on connect, and it
// re-sends events that were already delivered. Both are measurable in a real
// user export: 410 of 6,980 events arrived more than an hour after they
// occurred (worst case 8h26m, an 8-hour backlog dumped in ~90 s), and 140
// distinct (event_id, ts) pairs were delivered more than once — up to 4× —
// with a different frame `seq` each time, so nothing upstream de-dupes them.
// `db.dart`'s insertEvent already notes "the band re-sends events", and
// GestureDispatcher already carries a recency window for exactly this reason
// ("older than this = a drained/historical tap"). The charging alert never got
// the same treatment: it fired on any false→true edge, with the edge state held
// only in RAM — so every Android process restart (EdgeApplication pre-warm,
// KeepAliveWorker, FGS START_STICKY) re-armed it and the next replayed
// chargingOn buzzed again.
//
// Two independent guards, because neither is sufficient alone:
//   • RECENCY — an event describing a plug-in from hours ago is not news.
//     Handles first-time delivery of a stale backlogged event.
//   • IDENTITY — never announce a charge session at or before the last one
//     already announced, persisted across process restarts. Handles exact
//     re-sends and restart-driven re-arming, both of which are recent enough
//     to pass the recency check.
//
// Pure and synchronous: the caller owns the clock, the persisted values and the
// notification plugin. See device_alerts.dart for the wiring.
