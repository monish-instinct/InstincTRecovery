// import_container.dart — what did the user actually hand us?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (issues #199, #160)
//
// Every importer took the path from a `FileType.any` picker and piped it
// straight into `utf8.decoder`. Users picked the file their OTHER app told them
// to export — a WHOOP "My Data" export (a ZIP of CSVs) or a NOOP full backup
// (`.noopbak`, a ZIP holding `noop-backup.sqlite`) — and got:
//
//     FormatException: Unexpected extension byte (at offset 10)
//     FormatException: Invalid UTF-8 byte (at offset 10)
//
// Offset 10 is not a coincidence and it is not an encoding problem. A ZIP's
// first ten bytes (`PK\x03\x04`, version, flags, method) are all < 0x80, so the
// UTF-8 decoder always survives exactly that far and then hits byte 10 — the low
// byte of the DOS modification time, the first byte in the file that can have
// its high bit set. Byte 18 (the compressed size) is the next such field, which
// is where the other reported offset comes from. Both reports are ZIPs.
//
// (A genuinely mis-encoded CSV — latin1/cp1252, a Spanish or French export —
// fails differently: "Missing extension byte". None of the reports show that,
// so the "it's a localized CSV" theory does not explain them. Lenient decoding
// is still applied below, but as a separate, smaller fix.)
//
// So: sniff the container before decoding. A ZIP of CSVs is unwrapped and
// imported for real; anything we cannot use gets a message naming the file we
// DO want, instead of a byte offset.
