// noop_backup_import.dart — read a `.noopbak` full backup.
//
// A `.noopbak` is a ZIP around `noop-backup.sqlite`, NOOP's own GRDB database.
// On iOS it is the ONLY export NOOP offers, so every iOS user migrating across
// arrives with one; the raw-sensor CSV this importer originally required is
// Android-only. That is issue #160 for real, rather than the UTF-8 symptom.
//
// WHAT IT HOLDS (measured on a 13-day backup, 260 MB, NOOP 9.x):
//   hrSample(deviceId, ts, bpm)                 1,032,010 rows   1 Hz
//   rrInterval(deviceId, ts, rrMs)                505,358
//   gravitySample(deviceId, ts, x, y, z)        1,031,199        1 Hz
//   skinTempSample(deviceId, ts, raw)           1,031,199        1 Hz
//   stepSample(deviceId, ts, counter)           1,031,199        cumulative
//   spo2Sample / respSample                             0        present, empty
//   sleepSession / dailyMetric / metricSeries          12 / 14 / 24
// Timestamps are epoch SECONDS on a shared 1 Hz grid, which is the same shape as
// our own decoded substrate — so this is a FULL-FIDELITY source, not a summary
// import. We take the raw channels and re-derive; `sleepSession` and
// `dailyMetric` (NOOP's own scores) are deliberately NOT read, because a second
// set of stages and daily numbers would contradict the ones we compute.
//
// TWO TRAPS THIS FILE EXISTS TO AVOID:
//   1. `spo2Sample` and `respSample` are EMPTY in a real backup and a future
//      schema may drop them outright, so every table is probed before it is read.
//   2. deviceId is NOT consistent within one backup — the sample tables carry
//      "my-whoop" while sleepSession carries "my-whoop-noop". Nothing here
//      filters or joins on it: a user who replaced a strap has both ids over
//      disjoint spans and wants BOTH imported, and a per-second map keyed on ts
//      already collapses the (unrealistic) case of two straps worn at once.
//
// MEMORY. 3.6 M rows cannot be materialised, and sqflite serialises a whole
// result set on the platform side before any of it crosses the channel. So we
// walk one LOCAL DAY at a time (the unit [NoopIngest] derives anyway) and read
// each table for that day in pages.
