// ios_bg_task.dart — iOS BGProcessingTask + BGAppRefreshTask Dart handler.
//
// Native (BgSyncScheduler.swift) calls the `openstrap/bg_task` channel method
// `run` when iOS opportunistically wakes the app for a background task.
//   - BGProcessingTask (no arguments): FULL profile — runHeadlessSync()
//     (connect → flash offload → local store → disconnect → light derive)
//     followed by a heavy DerivationEngine pass (full sleep staging + 24h
//     spectra).
//   - BGAppRefreshTask ({'mode': 'sync'}): LIGHT profile — headless sync only,
//     NO heavy derivation (a refresh task's ~30 s budget can't fit it; the
//     light per-drain derive inside runHeadlessSync still runs).
// Returns true to signal completion.
//
// iOS gives BGProcessingTask a longer wall-clock budget than BGAppRefreshTask
// (up to ~2–3 min typically; device-dependent), but we must still be bounded.
// runHeadlessSync already has a timeout inside BleEngine; heavy derive is also
// bounded per-day. If the OS fires the expiration handler, the partial run is
// safe — the non-destructive cursor and the per-day finalisation flag let the
// next wake (or foreground open) catch up.
//
// Guard: if IosBleRestore reports the app already owns the band (foreground
// session active), we skip the headless sync to avoid fighting flutter_blue_plus
// for the peripheral, and go straight to derive. This shouldn't happen in
// practice (BGTasks only fire in the background), but it is defensive.
