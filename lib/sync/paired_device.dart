// PairedDevice — the LOCAL record of the band the user paired.
//
// LOCAL ONLY — there is no server. This survived the cloud excision (it used to
// live alongside BackendConfig/Session in sync/config.dart, both deleted).
//
// IT IS A TABLE NOW, not two SharedPreferences scalars. Prefs could hold
// exactly one band, carried no state beside the id, and could not be joined to
// anything — while `decoded_onehz` / `decoded_rr` / `samples` have been keyed
// by `device_id` since schema 47 with nothing on the other end of that key.
// The `device` table (schema 49) is that other end, and it can hold N rows.
//
// THE PREFS PAIR IS KEPT AS A MIRROR OF THE PRIMARY BAND, deliberately:
//  * The table lives in a database that can be quarantined and rebuilt
//    (`_openOrRebuild`) and that "Delete everything" empties. Losing a band's
//    identity to either of those means the user has to re-pair for no reason
//    they can see.
//  * `load()` is the FIRST line of app start-up, so the fallback is also the
//    thing that heals it: a table with no primary row and a mirror that has one
//    puts the row back.
// The table WINS whenever it has the row, so there is no ambiguity about which
// is authoritative — the mirror only ever answers when the table is silent.
//
// ponytail: the mirror carries the PRIMARY only. A second device lives in the
// table alone and does not survive a rebuild; give it its own mirror the day
// one can actually be paired, or stop rebuilding databases.
