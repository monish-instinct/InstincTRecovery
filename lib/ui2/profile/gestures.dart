// What a double-tap on the band does.
//
// The engine for this shipped a long time ago — the event decode, the recency
// and debounce guards, the persisted mapping, the native channel — and then the
// screen that sets it died with the old `lib/ui` tree. So the mapping sat on its
// `none` default with nothing able to change it: a feature that ran on every
// live event and could never do anything. This is the missing half.
//
// The list is not a fixed menu. It is whatever THIS phone said it can actually
// do — `GestureSettings.supported`, seeded from `DeviceActions.capabilities()`.
// An action drawn here and then silently doing nothing is worse than one that
// was never offered: iOS cannot touch system volume or a third-party player, and
// only Android has the Tasker broadcast, so on an iPhone those are simply not in
// the list. When native answers with nothing at all, the phone actions are
// absent AND SAY SO, rather than leaving a gap to guess at.
