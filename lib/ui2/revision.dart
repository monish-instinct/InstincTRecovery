// "The data under this screen changed — re-read it."
//
// One idiom, not two. A screen that loads in `initState` and never reads
// again is correct exactly until something else writes: an import lands sixty
// sessions, a derive rewrites the day, a workout is logged from the sheet, and
// the screen keeps rendering what it read at launch. Three of the five tabs
// are kept alive forever by the shell's IndexedStack, so "for the life of the
// widget" means "until the app is relaunched" — which is why the workaround
// was to leave the tab and come back.
//
// The signal already existed: [AppState.insightsRevision], a ValueNotifier the
// derive, the session writer and now the importers tick. Home and Workouts had
// each hand-rolled the same twenty lines of subscribe/compare/dispose around
// it; this is those twenty lines, once.
//
// WHY A ValueNotifier AND NOT notifyListeners: AppState ticks at ~1 Hz while a
// session is live (live HR, log lines). Anything watching AppState broadly
// rebuilds on every one of those — the reason `select` is used everywhere in
// this app. `insightsRevision` moves only when DURABLE data changed, and it is
// off the ChangeNotifier path entirely, so a subscriber re-reads on a derive
// or an import and never on a heartbeat.
