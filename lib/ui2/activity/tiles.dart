// A real map under a route, as a still picture.
//
// THIS IS THE ONLY THING IN THE APP THAT TALKS TO A SERVER ABOUT YOUR DATA.
// The z/x/y of a tile is a Web-Mercator encoding of the route's bounding box,
// so asking for one tells openstreetmap.org roughly where the session
// happened. Everything else here stays on the phone, so this cannot be
// implicit: [mapTilesAllowed] is off until the user turns it on, and
// [buildRouteMosaic] refuses without it. A card with no basemap is still a
// card — the route draws on the card's own ground.
//
// The share card is EXPORTED — `RenderRepaintBoundary.toImage` runs once and
// whatever is on screen at that instant is what leaves the phone. An
// interactive map widget loads its tiles asynchronously and would export blank
// about as often as not, which is why this is a fetch-then-paint mosaic rather
// than `flutter_map`: every tile is awaited before anything is drawn, so the
// export is deterministic.
//
// OpenStreetMap's tile usage policy is not decoration. This file honours it:
//   · a real User-Agent naming the app and its repo (the policy's first rule);
//   · a disk cache, so a card re-rendered ten times fetches once;
//   · at most [_maxParallel] requests in flight, which is what the policy
//     allows — a card used to hand all forty of its tiles to one `Future.wait`;
//   · a hard ceiling of [_maxTiles] per card and one zoom level per card, so
//     there is no bulk download here under any input;
//   · [kOsmAttribution], which the caller MUST render on the card. Tiles
//     without the credit are a licence breach, not a design choice.
//
// The tiles are the standard raster style, which is a light map. Painting it
// under a dark card would be a white slab, so the mosaic is tinted to the
// surface it lands on — see [_themeFilter]. Tinting is a display transform of
// our own copy; it does not touch the source data or the credit.
