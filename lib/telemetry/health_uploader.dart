// health_uploader.dart — OPT-IN contribution of the FULL local .db (raw + derived)
// to the companion backend. Heavy, so it runs at most once/day and only under good
// conditions (the cadence design): consent ON + Wi-Fi + charging + >24h since the
// last upload. The .db is gzipped before sending; the server keeps only the latest
// per device, so storage stays bounded. Entirely best-effort — never throws into
// the caller (the derive/BLE path).

/// Two-tier by release channel (see docs/privacy.html's "GitHub releases"
/// section, the user-facing policy): OFF for any official App Store/Play
/// Store submission (once that pipeline exists it must pass
/// `ENABLE_HEALTH_DATA_CONTRIBUTION=false` explicitly), ON for the GitHub
/// Releases build (.github/workflows/build.yml, both android + ios jobs) —
/// but "ON" here only means the feature EXISTS in that binary; actual
/// upload additionally requires the user to explicitly flip the in-app
/// toggle ("Contribute my health data", Settings › Privacy), which defaults
/// off. That row is hidden when this flag is false EXCEPT when the pref is
/// already true — an install that consented under an older build must be
/// able to withdraw it, and a hidden toggle is not a withdrawable consent.
/// Uploading someone's entire raw + derived health history to a
/// backend is by far the biggest privacy/compliance surface this app could
/// have, so keep the App Store/Play Store channel's "we do not collect
/// your health data" promise (docs/privacy.html) true by construction of
/// the CI config, not contingent on nobody flipping this default later.
