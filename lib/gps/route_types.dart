/// {'run', 'cycle', 'walk', 'hike'} while the catalogue's `typeKey` is
/// `name.toLowerCase().replaceAll(' ', '_')` — so the app actually stores
/// 'running', 'cycling', 'walking', 'hiking'. Nothing matched. Not one
/// activity, ever: the eligibility check returned before it could ask for
/// location permission, which is why iOS never even listed the app under
/// Location and every session said "no route".
///
/// Keep it here rather than in ui2 so lib/state and lib/gps can read it
/// without importing the UI layer. `route_types_match_catalogue_test.dart`
/// pins it equal to the catalogue's `gps: true` entries, so adding a GPS
/// activity and forgetting this list is a red test instead of a silent
/// missing map.
