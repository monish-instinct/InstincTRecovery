// A barcode, looked up against Open Food Facts.
//
// THIS IS AN OUTBOUND NETWORK CALL, and this app's whole position is that it
// makes none it did not ask you about. So it is shaped like the only other one
// that touches your data (ui2/activity/tiles.dart, the map basemap):
//   · [offLookupAllowed] gates every entry point here, so turning it off in
//     Settings stops the lookup dead — there is no code path that fetches
//     around it;
//   · it is user-initiated, one product per scan, never a batch and never a
//     background job;
//   · what leaves is the barcode. Not the meal, not the day, not who you are;
//   · a hit is cached in `food_def`, so scanning the same packet twice asks
//     openfoodfacts.org once;
//   · a real User-Agent, which their terms require;
//   · [kOffAttribution], which the caller MUST render wherever the numbers
//     land. ODbL data without the credit is a licence breach, not a design
//     choice.
//
// THE DATA IS OFTEN WRONG. Measured live, roughly 6% of products carrying
// nutrition data hold a physically impossible value, rising to about 20% among
// the most-scanned ones — Maggi Noodles filed with 2500 g of salt per 100 g,
// Balaji Wheels with 355,942, Parle-G with 3.4 kcal. The dominant failure is
// sodium in milligrams typed into the salt-in-grams box. It is a data-entry
// failure mode, not an Indian one, and OFF's own validators miss the quiet
// half: Tata Salt returns 0 g of salt per 100 g with no error tag at all.
//
// So nothing here is trusted on arrival. [gateNutrients] is the whole point of
// this file: a value that fails a physical check arrives ABSENT, and an absent
// value leaves its box EMPTY. Never a zero, never a guess — the same rule the
// rest of the app runs on, applied to somebody else's typing.
//
// And a scanned number is INPUT, not a measurement. OFF's own terms say the
// data must not be used for medical purposes; [FoodSource.barcode] exists so
// it can never be ranked as a panel the user read off a pack.
