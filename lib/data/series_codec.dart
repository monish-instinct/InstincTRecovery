// series_codec.dart — the compact wire format for the intra-day curves inside
// `day_result.payload_json`.
//
// WHY. A curve used to be stored as one JSON object per sample:
//
//   [{"t":1783572180,"v":77},{"t":1783572240,"v":80}]
//
// That is 27 bytes to carry two numbers, repeating the full 10-digit epoch in
// every element, for a curve that samples on a fixed 60-second grid. `series`
// was 74.5 KB of an 88 KB bundle and `day_result` is the ONE store that grows
// without bound (raw/decoded are capped at `rawRetentionDays`).
//
// WHY NOT gzip. `payload_json` is read by SQL, not just by Dart — the coach's
// `v_series` / `v_hypnogram` views run `json_each(json_extract(payload_json,
// '$.series.…'))` over it (db.dart `_ensureCoachViews`). A compressed BLOB is
// opaque to json1, and sqflite exposes no way to register a decompress
// function, so compressing the column would silently strip every intra-day
// curve from the coach (invariant 13). Everything here therefore stays PLAIN
// JSON that json1 can still walk.
//
// THREE SHAPES, all readable forever:
//
//   legacy  [{"t":N,"v":X}, …]                 never written again
//   grid    {"t0":N,"dt":N,"v":[X, …]}         regular sampling
//   offset  {"t0":N,"to":[N, …],"v":[X, …]}    irregular sampling
//
// `grid` reconstructs in pure SQL because json_each exposes an array's index as
// `key`: t = t0 + key*dt. `offset` pairs `to` and `v` on that same `key`.
//
// Legacy staying readable is what makes this migration-free: no rewrite pass
// runs inside `openDatabase` under iOS's CPU watchdog (invariant 11). Old rows
// are re-encoded later by a bounded background pass, off the durable-commit
// path.
//
// PURE. No I/O, no plugins, no Flutter — safe on any isolate.
