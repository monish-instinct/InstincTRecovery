// observation.dart — the type for a number OpenStrap did not compute.
//
// Deliberately NOT `Metric`. `Metric` carries `tier`, `confidence` and
// `inputs_used`, and every one of those is a statement about OUR method: which
// published algorithm ran, over which inputs, with how much of the window
// present. A vendor's Body Battery has no method we can describe, a typed-in
// mood has none at all, and an Apple Health step count has someone else's.
// Giving any of them a tier would be inventing a provenance claim.
//
// Lives in `edge/` on purpose. `analytics/` never sees this type — it stays
// device-blind and computes only from raw signal (OBSERVATION_SPEC §4).
//
// NAME COLLISION, on purpose and worth knowing about: `ui2/grammar.dart` also
// declares an `Observation` — the clinician-worthy-pattern CARD. No file
// imports both today. A file that ever needs both must prefix one import;
// renaming either would be worse, because both names are the right word for
// what they are.
