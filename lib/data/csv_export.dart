// CSV export — your data in a shape a spreadsheet can open.

// The whole-database export already exists and is the complete, lossless
// thing; this is the one people actually asked for, because "open it in
// Excel" and "restore it onto another phone" are different jobs and a SQLite
// file only does the second.
//
// Everything here reads through the derived views the coach already reads, so
// an export can never contain something the app itself would not show you, and
// it can never reach raw sensor rows or GPS.
//
// Absence is written as an EMPTY FIELD, never as 0. A spreadsheet cannot tell
// the difference afterwards, and a column of zeroes where a metric was simply
// not computed is the same fabrication the rest of the app refuses to make —
// except now it is in a file the user will average.
