// Nutrition — the log, the dictionary, and the day rollup.
//
// The primary logging unit is an EATING OCCASION, not a food. A one-tap "ate"
// with no macros at all is a complete, valid log: a trial comparing detailed
// against simplified logging found 49% of days logged versus 97%, with
// identical six-month weight loss. Macro detail is an opt-in tier and never
// the onboarding path, so every nutrient column is nullable and the rollup is
// built to report what it does not know rather than to zero-fill it.
//
// NULL IS NOT ZERO. A barcode that returns protein but no fibre writes
// `fibre_g = NULL`, and any total that summed a NULL reports itself partial.
// This is the app's founding rule made physical — see db.dart:2258.
//
// Pure rollup logic lives at the bottom as top-level functions so it is
// testable without a database.
