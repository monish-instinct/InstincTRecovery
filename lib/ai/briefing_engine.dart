// Pipeline: collect a COMPACT inputs snapshot from the repository (read-only,
// zero compute — same store the screens read) → build a small prompt → one-shot
// completion → parse into (one-liner, markdown breakdown) → cache in
// BriefingStore keyed day+period.

// Honesty contract (same as everywhere else in this app): a metric that is
// absent from the store is absent from the prompt — the system prompt forbids
// the model from mentioning anything it wasn't given, and the breakdown screen
// shows exactly the inputs snapshot so the user can see what the model saw.
//
// Omission alone is NOT that contract, though, which is what [kWithheldKey]
// exists for. See its doc: silence about a refused metric leaves the model free
// to narrate the thing it measures out of whatever else it was handed, and this
// file already documents that happening (see [readinessBand]).
