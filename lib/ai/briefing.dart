// briefing.dart — the daily AI briefing value type + its on-device cache.
//
// A Briefing is one generated note for one local day + period (morning = last
// night's sleep/recovery; evening = the nightly sweep, which is findings about
// today or nothing at all — see nightly_sweep.dart). It carries
// BOTH the notification-length one-liner and the short structured breakdown,
// plus the exact inputs snapshot it was generated from (so the breakdown screen
// can show "based on" metrics without re-querying, and regeneration is honest
// about what the model saw).
//
// Storage: SharedPreferences via the synchronous `Prefs` façade — one slot per
// period, newest-wins. Today's card reads it synchronously at build (no async
// flash); a stale (previous-day) slot simply reads back as null. This is a
// cache, not a record: losing it only means a regenerate.
