// nightly_sweep.dart — what, if anything, is worth saying about today.
//
// PURE. Takes each metric's own trailing history plus today's value and returns
// zero or more findings. Zero is the normal answer and a complete one: on most
// days nothing about a person is unusual, and a note that restates numbers the
// user looked at three hours ago has negative value.
//
// The bar a finding has to clear — all three are relative to THIS user, never
// to a population:
//   • it is outside the range this person's own history calls ordinary, or
//   • it is a value they have not reached before in the window, or
//   • two of the above landed on the same day.
// Nothing here scores, bands, diagnoses or ranks a day. It reports distance
// from the user's own middle, in the user's own units, with the window it was
// measured over attached — so the reader can disbelieve it.
//
// Robust statistics, for the reason the readiness composite learned the hard
// way: a median/MAD z is unmoved by the one 4am artefact in the window, and MAD
// legitimately collapses to zero on a quantized series (integer efficiency,
// step counts), so it falls back to mean/SD and abstains only when BOTH are
// flat. A flat series has no unusual day in it, which is a correct silence.
