// gesture_dispatcher.dart — turns a live band event into an action, with the guards
// that keep it safe. Wired ONLY into the foreground/live event path (AppState), never
// the headless drain (background_sync persists events but must not replay them).
//
// Two guards do the real work:
//  • Recency — a double-tap drained from the band's flash carries an OLD timestamp;
//    we refuse to act on anything that didn't happen in the last few seconds, so a
//    sync catch-up can't fire play/pause for a tap from this morning. (Only applies
//    when the band ts is plausible; a bogus RTC falls through to the debounce alone.)
//  • Debounce — the band can emit the event more than once per physical tap.
