// Sourced from AppState's local profile map (shared_preferences). Algorithms
// that NEED a field (HRmax via Tanaka, Keytel calories, TRIMP sex constant,
// fitness-age) read it from here; algorithms that don't simply ignore it.
//
// HONESTY: a missing field => the DEPENDENT metric must return null+confidence 0
// (never a fabricated default). The engine therefore passes nullable getters and
// only computes profile-gated metrics when the input is present.

  // one user's zone timeline and that same day's session zone bands were banded
  // off different ceilings with nothing on screen saying so.

  // property of its sensor, so an uncalibrated or unstamped strap gets no
  // ceiling rather than gen4's. Callers resolve it at the layer that knows
  // which device measured the window and pass it down. (TS-03a)
