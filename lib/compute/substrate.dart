// substrate.dart — the ONE decoded form of the raw R24 ledger (ARCHITECTURE_V2
// invariant 1 "Substrate-first" + the canonical Substrate schema).
//
// Raw R24 (1 Hz) is the canonical, replayable ledger. This file is the SINGLE
// decode point: `decodeSubstrate` turns a list of raw frame hexes into one
// continuous, time-sorted `Substrate`. Every downstream consumer (segmentation,
// per-day coordinator, every metric) slices THIS object — nothing decodes raw a
// second time.
//
// It also owns the DAY MODEL: `calendarDays` walks the substrate and
// returns wake-to-wake `PhysioDay`s anchored on each detected WAKE (sleep
// offset), with a noon-to-noon fallback so a day always exists when there's data.

/// and straight through the next record's.

/// runs of 300+ consecutive records in a real export, the intervals sum to
/// 0.967 of the `rec_ts` span (0.960-0.990 across runs) — so the beat train is

/// beats looks like, and not a set of per-second buckets. Several of a
/// record's intervals reach back out of its own second. Per-record placement
/// is nevertheless what THIS path can do — records arrive batched, out of
/// order and with gaps, so no cross-record chain is available at the write —
/// and a consumer that wants the chain can walk `rr_ms` itself.

///
///   * **wrap** (65500 → 100): the raw delta is negative. Re-reading it modulo

///   * **reset** (40000 → 0): the raw delta is also negative, and modulo 65536
///     gives an absurd 25536. It FAILS the budget and contributes nothing —
///     the boundary delta is dropped rather than invented. Losing at most one
///     inter-record delta is the honest cost of an ambiguity the counter
///     genuinely cannot resolve.
///
/// The plausibility budget is `clamp(gap, 60 s, 3600 s) × [maxStepsPerSecond]`,
/// and both ends of that clamp are load-bearing:
///
///   * the FLOOR (300 steps) exists because the counter's on-band update cadence

///     than every second, a literal `gap × 5` budget would reject almost every
///     real delta and silently report near-zero steps — a far worse failure than
///     the one this guard is for. 300 steps between two records still cannot be
///     confused with a 25 000-step reset artefact.
///   * the CEILING keeps a reset after a long unsynced stretch from buying
///     enough budget to pass as a wrap.
