// PURE POLICY — when the rolling per-user sleep profile may be folded, and when
// it is allowed to influence staging.
//
// Background. `cardioStager` (analytics) can blend a persisted per-user profile
// (`baselines` key `sleep_user_profile`) into tonight's per-night-local
// baselines, bounded by `SleepUserProfile.personalWeight` (0 → 0.5 as nights
// accumulate). The profile is produced by EWMA-folding one observation per
// finalized night.
//
// Two defects made that layer harmful in the field, and this policy exists to
// prevent both:
//
//  1. NOT IDEMPOTENT. The fold ran on every staging pass for a day — algo
//     bumps, BLE-drain re-derives, backfill sweeps — not once per day. A real
//     user export carried `nights: 1348` against 12 days of data. Because
//     `personalWeight` saturates at 28 nights, that pins the blend at its 0.5
//     cap immediately, and the EWMA (alpha ~2/15) collapses onto whichever day
//     was re-derived last instead of a representative fortnight. Replaying the
//     corrupt profile over the same 11 nights moved wake 4.3% → 36.4% and deep
//     1.9% → 0.0% on the worst night: the personalization layer was
//     re-manufacturing the very wake over-call cardio_stager.dart was written
//     to eliminate. Fold at most ONCE per day_id.
//
//  2. NO WARM-UP. Personalization was applied from the first night. The one
//     direct trial of per-subject personalization for wrist-PPG staging (van
//     der Aar et al. 2025, Physiol Meas, n=59, fine-tuned per subject and
//     scored against PSG) found performance improved in 82.5% of subjects and
//     that significant gains required >= 3 nights — which also means ~17.5%
//     got WORSE. A one- or two-night profile is therefore pure downside. Below
//     the floor we stay on per-night-local baselines, the cold-start path
//     cardio_stager.dart was actually validated on.
//
// A profile written before fold tracking existed carries no [foldedDaysKey].
// Its `nights` is untrustworthy and there is no record of which days went in,
// so it CANNOT be repaired — [usableProfileJson] discards it and lets the
// profile rebuild honestly.
