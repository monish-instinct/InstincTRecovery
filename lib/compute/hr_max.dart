// Spike-suppressed workout peak heart rate (issue #127).
//
// The Heart-rate page reports the max of per-MINUTE-averaged HR, so a brief PPG
// motion spike is averaged away (true peak ~143 bpm). The workout summary used
// to take a raw `hr.reduce(math.max)` over the 1 Hz samples with no artefact
// rejection, so a single transient could define the whole session's "max HR"
// (RR's report: 160 bpm summary vs a real 143 bpm peak). These helpers compute
// a peak that steps over such transients while STILL preserving a genuine brief
// effort peak — which a minute-mean would wrongly flatten. They are the single
// definition shared by all three producers (live tick, on-read recompute, and
// the workout-list fill) so the surfaces agree.
//
// Method:
//   1. Physiological reject — drop samples outside [kHrFloorBpm, ceiling]; the
//      ceiling is age-derived with headroom (real maxes exceed 220 − age) and
//      hard-capped. These are impossible readings, never effort.
//   2. Rolling median over a short odd window (~5 s at 1 Hz) — a 1–2 s spike can
//      never be the median of five samples, so the median steps over it; a
//      sustained climb survives because most of the window sits at the raised
//      level.
//   3. Peak = the maximum of that smoothed series.

// ── THE app's HR ceiling for zones / TRIMP / calories ────────────────────────
//
// There used to be five of these. `220 − age` at local_repository_impl.dart,
// app_state.dart and analytics' load_trimp; Tanaka `208 − 0.7·age` inlined in
// onehz_pipeline and crossday_pipeline; and `(220 − age) + 25` here. At 30 that
// is 190 vs 187, at 60 it is 160 vs 166 — so the same day's `zone_timeline` and
// the same day's session `zone_bands` were banded off different ceilings for
// one user, with nothing on screen saying so. [estimatedMaxHr] is the one
// definition; route every zone/TRIMP/calorie caller through it.
//
// `hrCeilingForAge` below is NOT one of them and is deliberately left alone: it
// is an artefact-plausibility bound with headroom above the estimate, whose job
// is to drop impossible samples before a spike defines a peak. Folding it into
// the training ceiling would clip real effort.

/// Estimated HRmax (bpm) for [age] — Tanaka (2001), `208 − 0.7 · age`. Null
/// only when the age is unknown.
///
/// THIS IS NOT DEVICE-GATED, AND IT WAS, AND THAT WAS THE BUG. Tanaka is a
/// population regression on AGE. It reads no sensor, no accelerometer and no
/// ADC; swapping the strap does not move the number by one bpm. Dispatching it
/// through `calibrationFor` therefore refused a ceiling for every row written
/// before schema 41 — `device_family` is NULL there and is never backfilled by
/// design — and with the ceiling went zones, TRIMP, strain, Keytel calories and
/// `max_hr_used` for a user's entire history. device.dart's contract is "unknown
/// family ⇒ refuse a CALIBRATION CONSTANT"; the test is *does the sensor change
/// the answer*, and here it does not.
///
/// [deviceFamily] is accepted and DELIBERATELY UNUSED, so the ~6 call sites that
/// already resolve the strap keep compiling and the parameter stays as the hook
/// for the day a family earns its own age line. Do not re-add a null return for
/// an unstamped strap.
///
/// What this returns is an ESTIMATE and every consumer must say so: zones built
/// on it carry `source: 'tanaka'` (see [trainingZones]), which is materially
/// different from `observed`/`karvonen`. The device-dependent ceiling — the one
/// the band actually MEASURED — is `observedCeilingBpm`, and that one still
/// refuses for an unknown family, in analytics' `observed_max_hr.dart`.

/// THE zone set every surface bands on — day zones, the day zone timeline and a
/// session's zone bands. One function so those three cannot drift (TS-03a's
/// unification, extended to the anchors rather than just the ceiling).
///
/// Which anchors it used is in `HeartRateZoneSet.source`, and the screens must
/// print it, because they are materially different claims:
///
/// * `karvonen` — %HRR bands between two heart rates the band MEASURED: the
///   observed ceiling ([observedCeilingBpm], TS-03) and the median of
///   [restingHrHistory]. Still a model — %HRR bands are a convention, not a
///   measurement of anyone's thresholds — but both ends are measured.
/// * `observed` — the ceiling is measured, the resting-HR history is still too
///   short for a reserve anchor ([HeartRateZones.reserveMinDays]), so these are
///   %HRmax bands off the observed ceiling.
/// * `tanaka` — no observed ceiling yet, OR one that does not reach the age
///   line: %HRmax off `208 − 0.7·age`, i.e. the AGE ESTIMATE. Byte-for-byte
///   what this app did before TS-03 landed.
///
/// THE CEILING IS `max(observed, estimate)`, AND THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE
/// RULE. An observed ceiling is ONE-SIDED evidence. Holding 195 proves the
/// ceiling is AT LEAST 195 — real information the age line does not have, and
/// it wins. Holding 166 proves nothing about the top: "has never gone maximal"
/// and "genuinely maxes at 166" produce the identical number, and on a wrist
/// the first is by far the commoner. Preferring it in BOTH directions is how a
/// 25-year-old whose hardest HELD effort was 166 got Z5 at 0.9·166 ≈ 149 bpm
/// and banked 13 of the 16 minutes of a steady run in "Max effort", captioned
/// as the age estimate.
///
/// On the session-detail path the ceiling was even set by the session being
/// graded — `_zoneAnchors` takes the all-time max, today included. The day
/// pipeline and the live tick do not: `observedHrCeilingBpm` is
/// strictly-before-today by design, and the live `zoneSet` is pinned at start.
///
/// There is deliberately NO tolerance band below the estimate. A threshold at
/// `estimate − k` puts a cliff in the middle of the range the ceiling creeps
/// through: at 30 an observed 177 would anchor at 177 and 176.9 at 187, moving
/// every edge 10 bpm on a 0.1 bpm change, with nothing on screen to explain it.
/// `max` is continuous — at 186.9 vs 187.1 only the LABEL moves.
///
/// The cost, which is chosen and not overlooked: someone whose HRmax is
/// genuinely below their age line gets a Z5 they cannot reach. That is an
/// under-report — an absence — where the old behaviour was an affirmative
/// "max effort" the data did not support, and this app abstains before it
/// asserts. The set says `tanaka`, and the zones screen names the held ceiling
/// and why it is not being used (`maximal_effort`).
///
/// Null only when there is no ceiling at all — no observed ceiling AND no age.
/// An unstamped strap is no longer one of those cases: Tanaka does not read a
/// sensor, so it lands on `tanaka` with the estimate's label, not on nothing.
///
/// The age estimate is deliberately NOT run through Karvonen: reserve bands off
/// a guessed ceiling are one measured anchor and one guessed one, which is not
/// the claim `karvonen` makes here and not worth moving every existing user's
/// zone boundaries for.
/// [manualZoneLowerBpm] is the user's own override — five ascending BPM
/// thresholds, one per zone's LOWER edge. Zone 5 has no upper edge for
/// CLASSIFICATION ([zoneNumber] never checks it — same as every computed
/// set), but [_manualZones] still gives it a finite display value, because
/// `.round()` on `double.infinity` throws and every payload builder rounds
/// it unconditionally. When present and well-formed the override wins
/// outright: no age, no ceiling, no resting history is consulted. When
/// absent or
/// malformed it falls straight through to the computed set below — an
/// override that failed to save is not license to fabricate one, but nor is
/// it license to erase the honest default underneath it.
