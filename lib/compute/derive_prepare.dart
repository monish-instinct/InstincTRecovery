    // its R-R block on its own. Walking only `frames` dropped every one of
    // those beats on the floor — silently, and permanently once the record was
    // acked and trimmed. The beat-only second still gets a 1 Hz slot so the
    // positional arrays stay 1:1 with `tsSec`; its sensor channels land on the
    // ABSENT sentinels (accel exactly (0,0,0), ADC 0, hr 0), never on a
